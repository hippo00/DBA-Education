# Case Update: Effective Hand-Off Template

**To use:** _Replace the (....) and the content within with what it is you asking for from the client and/or the update you are making in this case. Ensure to re-read your final version before saving this to your case update. This is listed as Internal Only, however you can copy/paste the below into a case update to the client._

An Effective Hand-off is part of Continuity.  Continuity will leave no room for error  as it relates to the resolution of the client issue.  In order to have an effective hand-off the following criteria needs to be met and documented in the case notes as an **internal IBM Note:**

  1.  (A Summary of the issue).
  
  2.  (Actions Taken thus far).
  
  3.  (Data collected: Including time stamps for the data).
  
  4.  (Next Steps.  Who owns the action).

Also include member(s) of IBM that have been involved with the issue broken out by role (if applicable). Example:
* Support (L2)
* Dev(L3)
* CSPO
* Sales
* Client

These should be members of the interested parties/teams of the case and is set by the client. This should be communicated to the other team as dictated local process for transfer.
