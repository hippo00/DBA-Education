### Get ready for Lightning...NOW!

#### The Lightning Console is now the default as of April 9, 2019.  
We expect you as Support Agents to be doing **ALL** of your work now in Lightning.  All new features are being developed in Lightning ONLY as the Classic interface is going away soon. If you have any issues which are preventing you from working full time on LIGHTNING, please let your Salesforce Integration Lead know or share your concern on the <a href="https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=CDJ8X6TQA Slack Channel" target="_blank">#csp-lightning </a> Slack channel. It is time to embrace the Lightning experience!
