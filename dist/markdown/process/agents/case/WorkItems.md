## View to find all Workitems
As Workitems are handled as objects in Salesforce it is possible to create a view where you can see all workitems in a list.
For that go to the top left corner of your Salesforce window and select Work

The view for Workitems can be configured in the same way as described in the [Case Views Howto](https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/caseViews)
