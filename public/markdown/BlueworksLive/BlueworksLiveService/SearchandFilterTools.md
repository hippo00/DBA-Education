## Overview 

IBM Blueworks Live has two powerful tools to help you find process models or other artifacts: Search and Filter. 

Search searches for all artifacts that match your search term. Filter limits the visible items to only those that match your term.

## Troubleshooting 

**Common Problems and references**

1.Why don’t I see different results when searching with the same input as my colleague? 
The user only sees the content that they have access to. 

<p>2.Do I have to use filters every time I want to locate my space or the process?</br>
No. The user can mark the commonly used spaces/ processes as ‘favorite’ by clicking on the yellow star next to the artefact.</p>
