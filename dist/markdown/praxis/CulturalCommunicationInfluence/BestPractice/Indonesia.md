# Indonesia

### Primary Belief Systems
* World's largest Muslim society
* Element of animist and other beliefs fused with Islam in rural areas
* Tolerant of other religions
* Business visits must take into account prayer time and religious holidays

### Indonesian Mindset
* Loyalty to hierarchy
* Saving face is important
* Avoid conflict wherever possible
* Sense that events in life are predetermined
* Weak work ethic (as perceived by westerners)
* 'Rubber time' (Jam Karet) - don't rush things!

### Key Points
* Saving face is an essential element of Indonesian culture -saving face yourself and allowing others to do the same.
* Personal relationships are more important in business than fast profits.
* People who are senior both in age and in business should be accorded respect.
* Indonesians relate better to the past and the present than they do to the future, so base business proposals and team motivation on what's happened before, rather than what may occur in the future. Most believe, in any case, that the future is predetermined.
* Communication is essential and face to face is better than in writing. An Indonesian sayingstates: 'Never write when you can call and never call when you can visit.'
* Always make allowances for cultural events like Ramadan, funerals, weddings, prayer time and even cemetery visits. Absenteeism in the workplace is very common.
* Managers need to adjust their style to paternalistic and genuinely caring in order to gain the cooperation of Indonesian workers.
* Always check that someone has followed your instructions. Announce them slowly, repeat, and check that the person understands.
* Don't expect Indonesians to meet deadlines. Time is fluid, or 'rubber', here.
* Handle conflict with care and focus on preserving the harmony of the group.
