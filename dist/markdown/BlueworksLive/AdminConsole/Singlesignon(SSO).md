## Overview 

As the account admin, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) support to allow your users to sign in to Blueworks Live using your company’s login credentials, eliminating the need to manage a separate password for Blueworks Live. 

You can configure Blueworks Live to use your company’s corporate directory to authenticate users, based on the SAML 2.0 standard. IBM must enable your account for SSO before SSO can be configured. Contact Blueworks Live Support when you are ready to do this task. 

Once your account allows SSO, a new tab is available on the Security tab of the Admin page. Click the Single Sign-On (SAML 2.0) tab and add the email domains of the users that you want to authenticate with SSO.  

Tip: After you enable SSO, you can go to the User Management tab and look at the Authentication column to see which users are now required to authenticate using SSO. 

If a domain is configured for both SSO and IBMid authentication, SSO takes precedence.
