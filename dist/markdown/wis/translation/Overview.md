* Case updates that are made by clients in the [languages supported for Translation](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/wis/translation/overview#languages) via MyCases page or via ECuRep will be translated into English. The English translation of these updates in the case feed is visible only to IBMers and serves as an aid for Support Analysts who can communicate only in English.
