### We are excited to announce the release of Case Prioritization V3 !! 
This new version has a host of UI improvements and features. The features added are a result of direct feedback received from the support analysts. 

### What does it include?

-  Improved performance 
    *  Cases are now lazy loaded incrementally into the Kanban and traditional (grid) view. 
    *  The Kanban view shows the total number of cases and the number loaded (increments of 15) 

-  User defined custom views can now be easily and quickly configured, saved and shared with others.
    *  Configuration options include filtering on all Case object fields and defining multiple columns (pipelines) in the Kanban view. 
    *  The ability to switch from multiple pipelines to a single pipeline and vice versa. 
                
-  Additional information in the Kanban view includes:
    *  System Down indicator
    *  Last update from the customer - flip the Kanban card by clicking on the Watson score

-  Ability to continue using the traditional view with Watson score as an added column
    *  Sort the grid (traditional) view on any of the displayed columns. 

-  Case Prioritization Widget "Mini Case Prioritization"  
    *  Users will be able to look at cases they own, any time, while on the console.
