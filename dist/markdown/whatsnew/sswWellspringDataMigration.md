### Wellspring data migration to Support Search with Watson
On April 7 we completed the ingestion of the remaining documents from Wellspring into Support Search with Watson (SSW). With the only exception of PMRs older than 10 years and archived DCF tech notes, SSW has now the full catalog of Wellspring documents. Due to data retention policies we don’t have plans to ingest PMRs older than 10 years but we will ingest the archived DCF technotes during Q2. 

With this latest addition, SSW has now a total of 30 million documents available for search.

If you find any discrepancies between Wellspring and SSW (other than the ones mentioned above) or any other issues related to this migration please get in touch with us.
