### Key Points
* Malaysia is a multicultural society -make sure you respect the differences between the three major ethnic groups -Malay, Chinese and Indian.
* When making conversation, family life is a good topic. This is often more effective for relationship -building than talking about business achievements.
* Building a relationship with your counterpart is very important and they tend not to engage in business with you until they know you personally.
* Make time for entertaining, as it's an important part of the businessprocess.
* Note the times for prayer for Muslims when scheduling appointments.
* Remember that Malaysians are indirect communicators and find it difficult to say 'no'.
* Make sure you are dealing with the right person, as often, only those at the very top of the hierarchy are empowered to make decisions.
* Be aware that the Malaysian concept of urgency and deadline may be influenced by their belief that the future can be pre-ordained.
* Attempt to maintain harmony at all times. Public display of anger would be considered rude and immature.
* As there is a strong respect for seniority and hierarchy, it is important to gain the trust of your Malaysian employees to know their real points of view.
