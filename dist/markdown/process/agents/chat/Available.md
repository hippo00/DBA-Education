**_Reminder_** : 

- Update your Status for a short absence change to Away or Busy in OmniChannel

- Log off before you leave

**Important**: Salesforce has a limitation to support the <a href="/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/uis/workbench/omnichannel">**Omni Channel**</a> status across multiple browser tabs/windows! There are a few scenarios where the **Online Status** in **Omni Channel** might not be fully reliable, for example: You opened the Agent Workbench in a second Browser window or tab, your **Online Status** there will not get properly picked up and even if you try to logon it might fail and even log you out of **Omni Channel** on the first tab/window. Thereforce, make sure you check your status in **Omni Channel** from time to time. If you really need to run the Agent Workbench in multiple tabs/windows, run the one thats using Omni on the very first tab and dont twist your **Online Status** on any other tab than this one.
