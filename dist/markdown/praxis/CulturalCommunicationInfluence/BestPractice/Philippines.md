* Take time to form a relationship before getting down to business.
* Adjust your expectations to the slower pace of life -becoming impatient is a waste of time.
* Filipinos are usually warm and hospitable and they respond well to outsiders who clearly show they are interested in relationship building and enjoying social time together.
* Make sure you are dealing with the decision maker. It may take several meetings and a lot of relationship-building to establish exactly who this is.
* Many Filipinos in business have difficulty in disagreeing with others explicitly so this hesitation to be frank with bad news means there is a need to patiently probe to discover real hidden negative views.
* Do not underestimate the power of the group. The family is the most important cultural unit and respect should be shown to its importance.
* Remember that smiling can disguise anger or embarrassment in a Filipino.
* Appearances really do matter and visitors should dress well especially when looking to create a positive first impression.
* This is a matriarchal society. Women enjoy equal social and political rightswith men.
* Filipina women can be tough negotiators and strong leaders; do not underestimate them or patronise them.
