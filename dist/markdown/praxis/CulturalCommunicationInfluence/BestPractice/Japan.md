### Below are some general statements of Client Personas, Likes, Dislikes, and Best Practices for working with clients.
 
**Client Personas**
* Expects the highest quality not only to our product, but to everything we do, including our communication and personal interactions. The client might provide a neutral feedback even if they are satisfied with IBM Support.
* Demanding on deadlines, which are not viewed as desirable guidelines but as strict drop-dead dates.
* Conservative and aversion to risk as they value stability and predictability.
* Many clients have their environments set up and maintained for them and do not like to make any changes (updates, bug fixes, patches) unless the root cause proves it solves their issue. It is common for them to expect to use the same environment for 7 - 10 years.

**Likes**
* “Get to the root of the matter” as a workaround or resolution is not good enough. Stick to the root cause. Be sensitive in asking the client to try any “a possible solution”.
* Be quick on the first relief.
* Enumerate required step-by-step instructions and keep good track record with detailed case and email updates.
* Use the suffix 'san' at end of the surname name (meaning of Mr and Mrs).

**Dislikes**
* Being told “No” without a very solid explanation. It is best to state why something isn't possible without using the word "no".
* Mistakes in emails or case updates.
* Acronym, idioms, and slang

**Best Practices**
* Be sensitive to commit on time to relief/resolution with consideration of time zones and Level-3 involvement.
* Double-check emails and case updates to avoid any mistakes or quality problems. Everything given to the client should be verified and work as desired.
* Have a positive, serious, and patient attitude in a response to any inquiry, no matter how unusual, indicating a willingness to try instead of saying “that’s not the kind of thing we do”.
* Show proper empathy with their situation - Saying “I’m Sorry” is a culturally important part of the support experience in Japan.
* Be polite - Complete the circle with “thank you”.
