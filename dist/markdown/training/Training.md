## Demos and Learning

Agents who are onboarding to Salesforce must complete training courses before they gain access to Salesforce. If you already completed the online training or a previously offered live training session, please use the videos in the online training as a resource.  Each course has two links:

* **Your Learning:** for IBM employees only
  For the Your Learning section: After you click a training link, log in, then select "Go to this activity" to access the course and its videos.
* **IBM Skills Gateway:** for IBM Business Partners and IBMers

The Salesforce for Support training courses prepare you for your upcoming transition to Salesforce. Each course includes short videos and quiz questions that guide you through the Salesforce process. Each course also includes an optional short homework assignment for you to complete in the staging environment.
 
In order to complete the training, you must access to the staging environment. <a href="https://ibm.biz/SF-IBMStaging-Console" target="_blank">Salesforce staging environment</a>. If you do not have access to staging, please reach out to your team's <a href="https://ibm.biz/BdYg6J" target="_blank">Integration Lead</a>

**Note:** First time users to Skills Gateway will have to complete a profile.  Next, when the course code comes up, you need to click on the magnifying glass beside the search bar to display the module(s)
