Live Agent is a comprehensive chat solution that makes it easy for IBM support organizationâ€™s agents and support supervisors to assist customers. Customers can start
chats with agents via the IBM Support Community. Our goal is to deploy a consistent Live Agent Configuration across all Support Missions. Once we have delivered
consistency we will continue to enable more Live Agent Features to improve the agent and customer experience if possible.
