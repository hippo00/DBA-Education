### Sprint 5

- Support Search with Watson results sent to separate new tabs so you can keep browsing the results without replacing the content of your search view. 

### Sprint 2

- Ability to save preference by user to remember filters and facets 
- When searching with “Support Search with Watson”, then switching to cases (or other) view and back it starts from Scratch and no previous search results are retained. Same happens when clicking on a search result and returning with browser back button (as no X to close is available) we’re back to the welcome screen. Sending search result list or individual search hits to their own tabs helps make the search much more usable.
- Fixed Defect - Feedback for curated answers does not work.
