# Blog Publishing
---

In the past, blog publishing was controlled at the business unit level. Some business units allowed authors to publish directly, while others had a specific process that usually included an assigned publisher who handled publishing duties for that group or business unit. As part of the Support Transformation initiative, we are attempting to simplify and unify this process. 

In the new unified process, all blog post will be authored in Drupal using the Technical Blog Post document type. The new process allows and promotes 'self-publishing' of your content, but you should check with your social manager to verify your units process includes this option. Regardless of the publishing option you use, it is the responsibility of the author to ensure the content is technically accurate and well written (grammar, style, etc...). To help ensure quality content, you may choose to use the Acrolinx grammar analysis tool or simply request a review from a colleague prior to publishing the post. 


### Obtaining Publish rights on the Drupal Platform:
Before you can publish a "Technical Blog Post", you need to have publisher rights on the Drupal platform.
