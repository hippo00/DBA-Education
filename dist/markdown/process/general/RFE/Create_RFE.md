## Request for Enhancement (RFE) process uses the Ideas module via the Internal Salesforce Community (image below). 
 

Currently, only those with access to the Production environment can submit an RFE on the Community. 
(If you are not on the platform and you have a suggestion, please work with your brand's Salesforce Integration Lead to get help creating and advocating for your RFE).

See below for how to submit, view, vote on, and raise focus on RFE suggestions


### Submit an idea:

Anyone who has access to the Salesforce production environment
can submit an idea through the internal Salesforce community at 
https://ibmsf.force.com/internal/s/. Click on the “Submit Ideas” tab and then click “Submit your idea.”

When you submit a new idea, you'll see other items that are already submitted that match your description.
Reviewing this list before submitting will help avoid duplicate idea submissions.

You can search for all existing ideas using the search for ideas function. 
You can also search for ideas you submitted by searching on your name (which is located in the Title of the submission).
Select where to direct your RFE request: Salesforce, Drupal or Watson.
