# What is the Client really saying? 

### Here are some examples of statements from our clients. Some are positive and others are negative. Don't ignore the negative comments as it will directly affect NPS.

### POSITIVE:
“The problem was quickly understood when the focus was on resolving”

### NEGATIVE: 
Can you please call me so I can explain the scenario? I sent all the data that you have asked for.“

### POSITIVE:
The technician called me promptly about my issue. She set up a Webex meeting so she could see into my computer and assist me with making the corrections in order for me to get the product working again.”

### POSITIVE:
“The support rep was able to furnish a complete response. He also gave me a work-around just in case we wanted it. Nice job, thank you”

### NEGATIVE:
"The person who worked this Service Request provided no value to us. The support that we received amounted to sending us links to the IBM Knowledge Center (which we had already reviewed) and telling us the description of error messages we received (which we were already aware of via Google). We were asked to send a memory dump but were given no instructions for producing the memory dump. We were then given incorrect instructions for producing a memory dump. Through our own effort and skill set, we ended up resolving the issue ourselves“.

### POSITIVE:
“The technician is thorough and detailed and even spent the time to walk through the doc with me and explain details about the internals that were impacting our systems. She is the BEST.”
