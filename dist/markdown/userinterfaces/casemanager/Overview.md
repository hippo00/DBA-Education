# Overview
 Case Viewer is a read only app that allows users to read cases in salesforce
 * Works only on IBM network 
 * reads salesforce in real time so the information is always up to date
 * Case properties, feed and diagnostics is the extent of the data displayed (We will extend to Filed Service fields later this year)
 * Case Viewer should not be used to do critical work, it is not a high availability tool
 * Does not have a on call support team
