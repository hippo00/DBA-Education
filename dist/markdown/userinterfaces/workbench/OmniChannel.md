Omni-Channel is a tool that sits inside of the Service Console that automatically pushes work to your users in real time. On the Cognitive Support Platform we use Omni-Channel to assign Cases and Chats to support agents. Omni-Channel currently supports leads, cases, chats, SOS video calls, social posts, orders, and custom objects with the goal to be getting the right work to the right person who has the capacity to help.

Omni Channel tells the system that an agent is available to take new work.
