## Overview 
Always encourage client to upgrate to the latest software versions to avoid running production systems on an unsupported configuration. Note that upgrades are different from migrations. Upgrades are an in-place upgrade of software. Migrations involve moving to a different platform, a different database, operating system or hardware.

Our customers have been a bit confused by this and are starting to ask a lot of questions regarding Oracle support.  
* The following things can be shared with customers:  
* Oracle 12.2 is supported starting with BPM 8.6 2017.12  
* We are changing our SPCRs so that 18C is also supported by all releases which support 12.2.  
* Detailed System Requirement reports are now updated and we do support Oracle 19c with all BPM 8.6 and BAW 18.x
