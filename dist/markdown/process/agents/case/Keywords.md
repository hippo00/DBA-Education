Beginning with Sprint 18, **Mission Keywords** are introduced to allow a Support Mission specific manual Classification of Cases. Managers in a Mission can create and manage the Keywords they want Agents in a Support Mission to use to classify Cases. 

Agents can use the Keywords on the Case Details Page:
* scroll down to the **Keyword Information** section

* NOTE: If you accidently click to add/remove a Keyword but don't want to add it, to cancel just close the window and start the process over. 

* you can use the Keyword Attribute to define Case Views (as Selectors) and let them show up on Case Views

* NOTE: Agents can manually edit the “Keyword” field on the page layout. Keywords manually entered (through the page layout) will not be registered on the support mission and will not be selectable using the UI of the **Click here to add Keywords** process. It is _recommended_ that agents use the **Click here to add Keywords** process however, manual editing is supported. Please be aware agents should not use both manual edits and the **Click here to add Keywords** process simultaneously. Possible side effects of using both models is that the manual edits could be overwritten by **Click here to add Keywords** process.
