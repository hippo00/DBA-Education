
It can happen that a Case is not opened for the correct Product or that after a first analysis it turns out that the Product needs to be changed. To do that you have several options  in Salesforce.

* Go to the Detail View of the Case

* Due to OWD an Agent only has access to Cases of the Support Mission he is assigned to. If you change the Product or SupportMission it might happen that you lose access to the Case after these changes. To avoid that you should add yourself to the **CaseTeam** before changing Product, SupportMission or even Skill. Hover over 'Case Team' on the top menu in the Details View

**Please note :** as soon as you change the Product the Owner is changed to the queue assigned to the Product as default owner For example if you change the Product to 'Business Automation Workflow' the Owner automatically changes to 'Manual Business Automation Workflow'. This happens even if the Case has been assigned to you before
