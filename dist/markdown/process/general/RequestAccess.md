#### *Access requests are typically processed once a week. As such, you should expect approval or rejection within 5 business days following your manager's approval of your request. It is our strong recommendation that requests for access are submitted at least 2 weeks in advance to avoid a disruption in your day-to-day working requirements. Please contact your Integration Lead with any quesitons or concerns.*


### Who needs access to the Cognitive Support Platform?

Engineers who actively edit and update customer cases require access to the Cognitive Support Platform. If you require only read-only access to cases, you must use the Case Viewer. For information on requesting access to Case Viewer, go <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/general/accessCM">here</a>.  

### Prerequisite for Access to the CSP

Note: Access to the Cognitive Support Platform requires training to be completed or the access request will be declined. Please go to the <a href="/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/training">Demos and Learning</a> page for more information, and complete Modules 1, 2, and 3 prior to requesting access. 

## How to request access

* Navigate to <a href="https://w3-03.ibm.com/finance/access/initAccessAppRequest.wss?appCode=SF_Service" target="_blank">OneTEAM</a>
* Click "Continue"
* Click "I accept the terms"
* Ensure the "Myself" radio button is highlighted (unless requesting on someone's behalf) and click "Continue". 
* In the text box for Business justification, be sure to enter the name of the business unit or product(s) you support and type the following: `I am part of [Insert product name] team and I need this tool to execute my day-to-day responsibilities to support IBM customers`
* Click "Continue"
* In the Environment drop-down, select Production for production access or CSP Staging/Training (.STG) for staging/training access. Please note that you will need to submit separate requests per environment if you need access to both production and staging/training.
* In the Access drop-down, select the role your manager has assigned to you (<a href="/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/usersroles">see here</a>). If requesting access to Production, please verify that you've completed all required training (if asked to verify training completion when attempting to gain access to the staging/training environment, simply check the box to continue - you'll be asked to verify again upon production submission).
* Click "Next"
* Review the information, and then click "Submit for Approval"

## Please note
* After submission for approval, your first-line manager will receive notification requesting that they either approve or reject your request. If approved by your manager, the Support Transformation team will review the request and provide final approval or rejection approximately once every business day leading up to and immediately following a schedule migration/rollout, and approximately once every week when no migrations or rollouts are scheduled. It remains our strong recommendation that engineers submit access requests at least 2 weeks in advance of when it's needed to avoid any disruption in their day-to-day working requirements.
* Once initially approved for access to the Cognitive Support Platform, failure to access and work cases or reports in Salesforce for more than 90 days will result in access request deletion and account deactivation. If reactivation is necessary, please follow the instructions above to resubmit. If you receive an Invalid Access Request error upon resubmission, delete any currenly GRANTED access requests for that environment by visiting https://w3-03.ibm.com/finance/access/accessDelete.wss and then try again. For read-only access, please see <a href="/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/general/accessCM">Case Viewer access instructions</a>.

##  How to suspend access
*  If the user no longer needs access to the Cognitive Support Platform, they can submit a delete access request in <a href="https://w3-03.ibm.com/finance/access/accessDelete.wss" target="_blank">OneTEAM</a>. 
* The user's manager can do the same by visiting OneTEAM. In Managers > Cancel/Delete Department Access/Functional Leaders > Cancel/Delete Global Extended Team Access, a listing of all direct reporting employees with granted or pending access requests can be deleted or canceled.  Up-line managers can manage access for indirect reporting employees as well (US employees only).  To view, delete or cancel access for indirect reporting employees, click the available link on the Department access page.
*  Note that as the user's profile is removed from BluePages, it is automatically deleted in OneTEAM and deactivated in the CSP as well. As such, unless they are changing roles and no longer need access, there's nothing you need to do aside from waiting on HR to process their removal from IBM.
