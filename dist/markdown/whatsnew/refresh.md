**Why are we doing this?** 

A refresh updates the environment’s metadata so that we can provide a realistic training environment and shorten cycle times for testing and new features. 

 

**When is this happening?** 

Salesforce Refresh is scheduled for 1/25/19 - 1/28/19.  

During the refresh process, all data and configurations from the production environment will be copied to the non-production environments so that both environments are aligned, providing a better testing and training experience. All Contact email addresses will be modified to avoid sending any communications from the “Staging” environment.

As part of the refresh process, the “Staging” domain name will be refreshed to “PreProd.” Short URLs will,remain the same.  Long URLs will be provided after refresh. Once the refresh has been completed, there will be a Salesforce pop-up message reminding you to bookmark the new URL for Staging. We will also communicate updates to your Integration Leads.
