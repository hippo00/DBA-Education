## Global Header

The new Global Header functionality allows the user to easily switch between the IBM Support Console and the IBM Support community. The ability for agents to easily log into the community
specifically as IBM Support Agents will improve client experience, in particular as the social and collaborative capabilities of the IBM Support community expand.

## Using the Global Header
From the IBM Support Console:
* Navigate to "My Settings" by clicking the user icon in the top right of the screen, and then select "My Settings". You will see the Global Header bar along the top of the screen.
* On the far left of the Global Header click "IBM Internal"; this will open the dropdown. The options should will read "IBM Internal", "IBM Support Community" and "Internal IBM SF
Support"
* Right-click "IBM Support Community" to open in a new tab, where you will be logged into your agent profile on the IBM Support community. 

## Nicknames
Additionally, the new Nickname feature will allow you to modify the name that is displayed as you interact with other users in forum posts in the IBM Support community. Accessible from
your user details in IBM Service Console, your “nickname” enables you to limit the amount of personal information that you share within the community. Additionally, your "Company" will be
displayed next to your nickname in product discussions in the IBM Support community.

**Note**: There will be a mass update for all user nicknames in the IBM Support community, which will set your "nickname" to your email without @xx.ibm.com (for example:
JaneAgent@us.ibm.com would become JaneAgent). If two nicknames are the same, there will be a "1" appended to the nickname (for example, Jane Agent will become JaneAgent1). See the
next section to learn how to edit your nickname. 

## Editing Your Nickname and Company
From the IBM Service Console, click on the User Icon in the top right corner of the page. Select "My Settings". This will direct you to the “My Settings” page. From the "My Settings" page you
will then click the "Personal" tab on the panel to the left of the screen.

Select "Personal Information" from the drop down. On the “Personal Information” page navigate to the "Details" section. This is where you will edit your "Nickname" that will be displayed when
you interact with the IBM Support community. From the "Personal Information" section where you edited the nickname, scroll down to "My Work Information". Update your "Company" to "IBM support". "IBM support" will now display next to your "Nickname" on forum posts in the IBM Support community. Note: on Case feeds, your company will always display as “IBM” – updating the “Company” field does not affect this.

In the IBM Support community, this your "Nickname" will be reflected in a "Display name" field, as shown below. You can also edit your nickname from the IBM Support community using this
field. Click on the user icon in the top right corner of the page. Select "My Profile." You will be directed to the "My Profile" page, where you can click into the "Display name" field in order to
change your nickname.

Once you have chosen your desired nickname, click "Save" in the bottom right. The changes you made will be reflected in your user details in the IBM Support Console, in "My Profile" on the IBM Support community, and on forum posts in the IBM Support community.

**Note:** Nicknames must be unique: no two people in the IBM Support Community can have the same nickname. If the nickname is already in use, you will see the error message pictured
below in the IBM Support Console and IBM Support community settings, respectively.
