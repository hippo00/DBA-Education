#### **Best Practices**
 * Use 3-4 tags (dW Answers allows a maximum of 8 tags)
 * Version-specific tags should not be used; instead add the version to the text.
 
 
#### **Who can add, edit or remove tags?**
 * Tags are created when a question is asked or added  to an existing question.
 * Tags can be added to an existing question by a Moderator, the question owner and those who have 100 reputation points
 * Moderator can remove/edit unnecessary tags
 
#### **Sample tags for different scenarios:**
 * If a customer had a hang issue while installing WebSphere Application Server, the tags maybe: WebSphere or was and install
 * If a customer had a Business Space issue while using IBM Business Monitor, the tags maybe: monitor and businessspace
