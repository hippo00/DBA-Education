Hello (Client Name), We understand that you have not been able to reproduce the issue in your lab environment at this time. As we do not have a specific set of steps to replicate the problem in-house, we will need to enable debug to obtain additional information. We hope to gather more specific logs to help determine the root cause of the problem.  Collection of this data may take a few iterations to ensure that we obtain a clear understanding of the issue being experienced.  We appreciate your patience in this matter and hope to isolate the issue as quickly as we can. 

Thanks, (IBM Support Team Name)
