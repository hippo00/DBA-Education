You will need to confirm the Accounts the Contact is associated with to enusre that Case is created against the correct Account.  _**If they have multiple "Related Accounts" (See below) ask the client to confirm under which Account the Case should be created**._  

Note: Use the CMR/ICN to ensure you select the correct Account, failing to do so may cause issues with the contact accessing the Case on the community or exposing client confidential information under the wrong account.
