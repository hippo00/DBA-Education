**Note about temporary changes to Watson Language Translator:**  

Intermittent errors impacting the clientâ€™s Case Open process and the ability to add interested parities was discovered.  The source was traced to the Watson Language Translator.  Portions of this feature have been temporarily turned off until a fix can be deployed.  Impact:  Agents may see **translation** of the subject line but will not see a translated description on the case **until we redeploy the translation feature**. The Case Open process and ability to add interested parties is now functioning properly.  We are targeting for redeploy in January.



After the deployment of Spanish on August 16, and Portuguese, French and German on Oct 23, we are excited to now announce the availability of Watson Language Translator for Simplified Chinese. Language translations for incoming Simplified Chinese, Portuguese, French, German and Spanish case updates, made through the Support Community page, will be automatically detected and translated to English by the Watson Language Translator in the case feed. This will be applicable to all Support Missions.

The English translation of the update in the case feed will be visible only to IBMers and will serve as an aid for Support Analysts who can communicate only in English. We have more languages in the pipeline for you like Traditional Chinese and Japanese that are currently under evaluation in our pilot program. As the bi-lingual Support Analysts participating in the pilot give us the feedback that the machine translation quality is appropriate for the business, we will get these rolled out as well!

If you are interested in participating in the pilot or need more details, please contact Sunil Bhatnagar (bhatnags@us.ibm.com)
