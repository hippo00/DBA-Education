**Praxis** means putting ideas and theories into practice! We are providing you the ideas and samples that you can now put into practice while working more effectively with our clients. The topics in this section were identified from detractor comments from our NPS surveys across all of IBM Support. There are over 20 topics that are considered to be "challenge areas" for our support engineers when working with our clients. We have created assets to help address these topics in the form of bite size education, best practices, pointers (how to and where to find), templates for emails and case update, and talking points for phone call and Webex conversations.
