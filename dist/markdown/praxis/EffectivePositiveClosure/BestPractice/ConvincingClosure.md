# Convincing the client to close the case

* Remind clients of our reopen policy and that they have the ability to reopen the case.
* Offer to answer any follow-up questions, even after closure.
* If a fix has been provided, but the client hasnâ€™t implemented it within a couple of weeks, ask to close the case.
* If a new issue arises from a current case:
  * Explain that each individual issue needs to be documented separately in case the need for escalation arises.
  * Explain that clear and concise descriptions are needed. Multiple issues in the same case confuse the situation.
  * If the client is adamant about not opening a new case, offer to open the new case.
  * Assure the client that the history for their old case will not be lost. We archive the case record in our system.
