#### Classic Vs. Lightning - Comparison of steps used tro perform tasks / activities / actions in the Salesforce Console  

* In most cases the basic functionality / usage of options hasn't changed - Where you look to find options has changed 
* Unlike Classic, the Case Details sections/categories in the Lightning left sidebar do not have buttons or links to perform tasks 
* Quick Action buttons seen at the top of the Feed page in Classic are now at the top of Case Details in the left sidebar. If you don't see a button the option should be in the dropdown list	
* Buttons and link options seen in Case Details sections/categories such as "Diagnostics > AE Files" in Classic are now at the top of Case Details in the left sidebar.   If you don't see a button the option should be in the dropdown list		 
* Related Links seen at the top of Case Details in Classic are now at the top of Case Details in the left sidebar just below Quick Action buttons/dropdown. You may need to "Show All".		 |
