### Blog criteria:  What type of article constitutes a blog post:
---
By definition a blog is - a regularly updated website or webpage, typically run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style.  For more specific details and content type definitions, review the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/social/blogging/blogWG" target="_blank"> Blog Writing Guide. </a> Content that does not fall into any of these types should be written as a standard IBM Support Technical article of type - Troubleshooting, FAQ, System Requirements, MustGathers, etc...

### Rules, Tips, Best Practices, and Guidelines:
---
- Speak in first person and add personality, make it fun (something you would want to read)
- Keep entries to a reasonable length.  They should be a few pages or less but should also be somewhat detailed in nature.
- Titles should be descriptive, creative, and present our products in a positive way. Remember, the title has a big impact on search rankings.
- Follow the Social Computing Guidelines,  Business Conduct Guidelines, and GDPR for guidance on blog etiquette and restrictions,
- Remove any customer-specific information (names, applids, system names, data)
- If your entry involves a competitor, do not refer to the competitor by name
- Use words and tags that users are likely to use for searching.  Important: Most search algorithms focus on the first few hundred characters.  Take care to determine what your most common keywords are and use them as much as possible in the Blog title and abstract.  
- If you are looking for a topic to write about, consider using ARM to find content that has high utilization. 
- Have a technical expert (SME) for the topic review your content for technical accuracy. 
- Ensure that your blog entry is formatted properly and has a clean look/appearance - fonts and spacing are consistent, tables are aligned, images and video clips are appropriately sized, etc...
- Ensure that your text reads well.  Use Acrolinx to analyze the text for grammar, spelling, and style.  
- Validate your document type. Make sure it fits into one of the defined 'content types' for a Blog post.
- A blog entry can be brand new content or it can be used to expand on a topic that is published elsewhere. Blog topics can (and in most cases should) be new content since we don't want to duplicate content.

Good blog content is somewhere between a simple FAQ or forum post, and a subject matter deep dive (IBM Whitepaper)   It should cover a topic with a wider scope than just a simple error condition and a solution (problem/resolution), but it shouldn't be too long (it needs to be an easy read).  If it is longer than what is described here, you should break it into a series of posts)
