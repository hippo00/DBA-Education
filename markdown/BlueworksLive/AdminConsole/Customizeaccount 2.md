#### You can customize your Blueworks Live account to meet the needs of your organization.

### Branding

Customize the account to look like an internal portal by changing the color scheme and uploading the company logo for both Blueworks Live and for printable documents from Blueworks Live.

On the Admin page, go to the ***Customization*** tab and configure the settings in the Branding section to:

* Add a custom logo and choose a color scheme to apply to the header and footer of all Blueworks Live pages.

* Customize the email notifications sent out by Blueworks Live to include a custom subject line and a company logo.

* Add a custom logo to process documentation that is exported to Microsoft Word.

* Add a footer to include custom text, such as "Confidential. Do not distribute," in documentation that is exported to Microsoft Word.

### Adding a custom help page

You can provide custom help documentation to help users adhere to your organization-specific guidelines for using Blueworks Live.

On the Admin page, go to the ***Customization*** tab and configure the settings in the Help section.

1.Click ***Custom help page***.

2.Provide a title for your help page and specify an Account Admin Contact who will be a contact person for the content in the help page.

3.Use the rich text editor to enter your custom help content. You can add html links to more detailed documentation and policies governing your organization's use of Blueworks Live.

4.Click ***Update*** to apply your changes.

When the user clicks the ***Help*** link in the tool bar, your custom page will be displayed instead of the generic Blueworks Live help.

### Customizing properties

You can customize the properties that are displayed in the Details tab for process blueprints and decision diagrams.

Custom properties are configured in the ***Properties*** tab of the Admin page.

* To show or hide predefined properties such as Business Owners, Cost, and so on, use the check boxes to mark properties visible or invisible.

* To add your own custom properties to process blueprints, click one of the links in the Custom Process Properties section and add either a text or number property. Optionally, specify a tooltip to provide users with additional information about the property.

* To restrict a custom property to a specific set of values, click the ***Enumerated*** column. To add values, a glossary manager must open the glossary and add new values to the set of allowed values. You can also restrict the Systems property in the same way.

### Enabling email services

You can enable the prebuilt email service for your account, which allows users to configure service tasks that send email messages during the running of a process app.

In the Admin page, go to Process App Management > Service Catalog. Click the ***Enable*** check box to enable or disable the email service.

### Warning about adding non-preferred terms to the glossary

If your glossary managers want to encourage users to use specific glossary terms and discourage them from creating unnecessary new ones, you can enable a warning when users add non-preferred terms to the glossary.

In the Admin page, go to Customization > Library and check ***Allow glossary manager to enable warnings for users that enter non-preferred values***. A glossary manager can now open each category in the glossary and decide whether to check the ***Warn users that enter non-preferred values*** check box. If the box is checked, a user who enters a non-preferred value in that category sees a warning and must close it before proceeding.
