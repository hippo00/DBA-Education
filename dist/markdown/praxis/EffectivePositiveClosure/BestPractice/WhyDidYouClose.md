# Why did you close my case? I don't have a fix for my defect yet!

There are times where, from a client’s perspective, they do not feel that they were provided with a solution for their problem, even though a fix was created for the defect. This sometimes results in a client requesting that the case remain open until a fix is received and verified. However, this is not how the IBM support process works, and here is why:

The case investigation is complete once a fix is created. At this point, the case is closed because we completed the investigation that is requested and we have determined that the issue warrants either a code or documentation fix. At this point, the fix process of working on resolving the defect begins. 

When a fix is ready, IBM delivers the fix in the form of a fix-pack on IBM’s Fix Central download site. A notice is sent to everyone who has subscribed to the fix notifying them that the fix is available. If assistance with installing or working with the provided fix is needed, a new case to request that assistance can be created. Sometimes our clients get caught up in the process, viewing it as being complex. However, following this process for cases and fixes remains the most effective process for us to do a better job for you and all of our clients. 

Clients might have a difference in understanding about what a resolution looks like based on our support process. We can all agree that resolution is getting an answer to the question or problem. When we mark a case as resolved, it’s not lost forever. We can still update it for up to 28 days and we can reference it for years. If a case becomes a fix, we are still working it, just through a different set of procedures. 

The important thing to remember is, regardless of the type of record we use to track the work, IBM is committed to solving your issues and ensuring your implementation of your IBM product is successful. We look forward to supporting you!
