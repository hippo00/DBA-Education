# Situation Appraisal

## When a client's issue is unclear, it is best to understand the "big picture".  The best technique is to follow four basic steps:

### 1) Identify Concerns
* Identify concerns that impact the client and require action to resolve
* Ask:
  * What would you like to do/achieve? What is your expected outcome?
  * What technical issues are you experiencing?
  * What problems are occurring?
  * What changes are anticipated?
  * What other concerns are those issues creating?
  * What else?
* Probe for both technical and non-technical issues impacting the client.
* List all issues without discussion <-- Listen to the client.
* If necessary, Separate and Clarify Concerns.
  * To ‘separate’ means to divide a complex concern into two or more single concerns that can be worked-on one at a time.
  * To ‘clarify’ means to restate a concern to better understand the action that is needed to resolve it.
  * Stop separating and clarifying a concern if how to resolve it is clear.
  * Separate by asking:
    * What else in that area is failing?
    * What other specific concerns do you have related to the failure?
    * What’s the evidence?
  * Clarify by asking:
    * What do you mean by…? 
    * What should be happening versus what is actually happening?
    * What specific thing, part, or function is failing?
    * What specifically indicates the failure?
  
**Goal: Document the specific action statements**
* Specific action statements are delegated or assigned to a group. They often take the format of <verb> + <noun> and are the result of clarifying and separating client concerns.

### 2) Set Priority
* Consider Current Impact, Future Impact, and Time-frame.
* Identify one or more concerns to resolve first.
* To make efficient use of available resources ask:
  * Using existing priority-setting criteria, at what level should the issue be assigned?
* If still unclear, assess:
  * What is the current impact (seriousness) of this concern not being resolved?
  * What will be the future impact (growth) if this is left unresolved?
  * What is the time frame (urgency)—specific time or date—when this will become difficult, expensive, impossible, or meaningless to    resolve?
* Confirm and record specific, supporting data for current impact and future impact.
	
### 3) Plan Next Steps
* Determine Analysis Needed.
* Identify the appropriate action or process or analysis.
* To ensure effective and efficient use of analysis ask: 
  * What analytic process is required for resolution? 
    * Problem Analysis.
    * Decision Analysis.
    * Situation Appraisal.
    * No analysis = Just Do It!
  * How much of that process is needed?
  * What follow-on steps or actions are needed? What else?
  * Record the process and other actions that are needed for resolution. 
### 4) Plan Involvement
* Determine the help needed.
* Assign responsibility and schedule the next steps.
* Determine who does what, and by when?
