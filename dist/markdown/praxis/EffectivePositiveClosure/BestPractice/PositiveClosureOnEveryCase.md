# How to do a positive closure on every case

**The following are steps that help ensure that you close each case with a positive closure.**
* _Summarize the resolution:_ Describe the resolution & send summary to the client
  * _Positive closure:_ Ensure that the client is happy before closure (validate measures of success), open new case for client if they have other pending issues
  * _Engage:_ If there are any client concerns, engage team lead or manager for assistance before close
* One area that requires special attention to wording is in cases where the client solves it on their own or we apply the three strike rule.
* If you get concurrence to close the case while on the phone with the client, follow up the phone conversation with the positive closure email.
* Most support representatives have this set up as a template and they modify the following:
  * The number of days the client has to reopen the case (the maximum as stated in the Cognitive Support Platform)
* If the client happened to resolve the case, while you are researching it, it is also generally good practice to follow up with them and see what they did to move forward with their concern.
