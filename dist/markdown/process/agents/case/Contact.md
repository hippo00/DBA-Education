There is a situation where a contact’s primary user account is not the user account on a case they are associated to. In this situation, it is possible that you may not have access to the contact record. We have added a sidebar component in the case page layout that will allow you to directly edit some of the contact’s details.

* **First Name** – Edits the first name of the contact
* **Last Name** – Edits the last name of the contact
* **Email** – Edits the email of the contact
* **Phone Number** – Edits the phone number of the contact
* **Search by Account Name** – This adds a related account to the contact

After you have edited the fields and press update you will see this screen (below):

Agents need to click "Return to Edit Page" This will refresh the case and update the contact details on the case details page.
