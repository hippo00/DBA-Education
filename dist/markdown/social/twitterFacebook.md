### Getting Social with Twitter and Facebook

Twitter and Facebook are the two primary social channels we use to inform our support customers about the latest product news and service/maintenance issues.  We also use these channels to pro-actively broadcast information that can help them avoid, or quickly learn how to address a newly discovered issue with their IBM products.  

Some business units are active on both channels, while others prefer to use just one and some areas may choose not to engage in these channels at all.  Refer to the tables below to determine if your business unit uses one or both of these channels.

### How can I help as a Technical Support Engineer?
TSE's are typically the first to learn of a new product issue that is having an impact on our customers.   That insight can be valuable in preventing an onslaught of new support cases. One way to put that information to work is by getting it posted to our social channels as quickly as possible and therefore in front of many of our customers(followers).  

The process to get something posted to you team's Twitter account is to contact either your support teams Knowledge Champion or your business unit's<a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/social/generalInfo/contacts" target="_blank" > Social Support manager. </a>
