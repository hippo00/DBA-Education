When working a case with a client, Support Agents can easily check the client’s Community profile and easily instruct clients to update some of the common profile settings. The correct selections will help to improve the client’s support experience within the Support Community. 

This document will cover steps to:
* Change the default time zone to reflect the client’s correct time zone
* Set their case notification preference
* Change their role from "Basic" to "Full". Support Agents do not have the ability to change a client’s user role setting themselves. 

The process begins by asking the client to sign in to the Support Community (www.ibm.com/mysupport) using their email address as shown in the screenshot below.

Next, select the 'person' icon in the upper right section of the page:

Select 'Profile' to see the field to select the client’s time zone (so that the time shows correctly for the client.) The default time zone is Central Time. Selecting "Settings" will allow the user to move to the next step next to make further updates:

Within the "Settings" screen is the option to Change the “Case Notification Settings”. Here the client can select the content they would like included in any case emails (by default, all emails will include the case number, case status, and a link to the case):

The final step is for the client to select the "save" button.
