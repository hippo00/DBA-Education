## Overview 

Blueworks Live has a very efficient sales group that assists clients who want Blueworks Live to establish their licensing requirements and the term of their subscription to Blueworks Live. Billing as well as provisioning for all paid client accounts is now handled by the IBM Project Office.  

Once Sales and the client have established all licensing requirements and term of operation, a method of purchase is established and a purchase order is generated.  At that point it goes to the IBM Project Office to setup a billing cycle …. the project office also handles provisioning the account. For example they will set how many Editor licenses or Contributor licenses are in the account and they will set the expiration date for the account. 

Any further licensing changes or date changes to the account are also handled by the IBM Project Office.

## Troubleshooting 

The following scenarios describe instances where you may need to contact Sales and/or Billing 

A sales representative has contacted you requesting that you make changes to a client’s licensing.  Refer the sales representative to the correct IBM Project Office 

A client has contacted you asking how to go about getting a Blueworks Live account.  Check the client’s email on the suadmin tool. If the email cannot be found then the client can open their own trial account at  https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-37086 . If you do find the client’s email associated to an account the the client will need to go through Sales to go through the IBM Project Office to setup a new account. 

A sales represntative has contacted you to reset a clietn account expiration date. Contact the correct IBM Project Office.
