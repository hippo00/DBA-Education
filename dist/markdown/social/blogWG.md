### IBM Support writing guide for blogging:

A blog(shortened version of “weblog”) is a digital journal, or informational website,that displays information in reverse chronological order; where the latest posts appear first. A blog is a platform or space where the author, or group of authors, share information or opinions on a particular subject or theme.

A blog post is an entry (or article) that an author writes and publishes to a blog. Blog posts are a content format that can include information in the form of text, photos, info graphics, videos, or a combination of each.

The general guidance for what can constitute a blog post in the new,unified IBM Support blog, focuses on content that is based on thought leadership and opinion. Generally,this content should be product or business unit independent,and focused on ideas that reach beyond technical how-to information.

In IBM Support,we author articles of multiple content types by using the Drupal in Support tool.  Some of these content types are appropriate for blog posts, and some are more appropriate for technical articles covering recommended resources, troubleshooting, or other more product-specific technical information. The following link contains a chart that describes which content types are most appropriate for the blog post format:

**Content Type definitions for blog posts** (From the IBM Content Experience site at: https://contentx.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/content-types/)

| Content Type  |  Purpose  |
|---------------|-----------|
| Opinion   |  An IBM or individual IBMer'sopinion about a business or technical topic. Opinions should support the IBM business as much as possible and be backed up by some form of quantitative or qualitative data.|
| Thought Leadership  |  Content that demonstrates the author's knowledge, vision, or expertise about a solution area, a technology or a current topic. |
| Interview  |  Records a conversation with an SME or client who describes how IBM helped solve a business problem. This is a talent-centric approach to sharing knowledge and the personality of the expert. Typical interview formats involve hosted and non-hosted structures that drive the conversation forward with how IBM helped solve a business problem. |
| News   |  Provides information about current events or developments about IBM or an IBM offering.  |
|Event   |  Outlines a coordinated set of activities, speakers and demonstrations supporting a common theme. |
