Using Salesforce to Identify whether a Contact is registered for the IBM Support Community

## Situation
An engineer responds to a customer but receives no response or acknowledgement that the Post(s) via the Salesforce Case has been received by that customer.

## Recommended process for the Engineer
If you do not get any feedback from the customer to your first 2 reach-outs via Posts in the Salesforce Case, here’s what you should do:

 In the Case Feed, double check you sent the Posts to the customer and not to IBM Only.  If it has 'To IBM Only" alongside your name in the Post, resend the Post(s) but ensure you select Public as the access type, before sending.

Also make sure that the client has their notifications set to send email updates, and make sure a valid email exists for them.

Once you clarify that the Posts were set to be sent to the customer and they are set up to receive the updates, you should verify their contact details include access to the IBM Support Community, by clicking on their Contact Name in the Case Details view.  The Contact details are displayed and if you click the drop-down arrow alongside Manage External User, then choose View Customer User

In the top left-hand corner one of the fields is called Profile and if it has IBM Support Community Full Access (or similar) then they should be receiving the notifications about the Case being updated.
