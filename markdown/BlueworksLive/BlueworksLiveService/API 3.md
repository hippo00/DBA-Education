## Overview 

The Blueworks Live API provides access to a limited subset of the available Blueworks Live functions, such as search, list process details, and launch work instances. All access requires authentication using either a valid user name and password, which is restricted based on the normal Blueworks Live roles and permissions, or an access token that has global access to the account.
