# Mexico

### Below are some general statements of Client Personas, Likes, Dislikes, and Best Practices for working with clients.

### Client Personas

* Mexico is far more diverse than non-Mexicans realize. It has indigenous indian populations that still speak pre-columbian languages (Nahuatl and Maya)
  * Mexicans speak a variety of languages, including Spanish and English 
* It shares many characteristics with other Spanish-colonized, sun-belt countries. 
* Most Mexicans are quite industrious and take few vacation days.
* They are frequently more deferential to foreign technical specialists compared to local IT service/support professionals. 
* Mexican people are soft spoken. A raised voice is thought to indicate anger; staying calm is a respected virtue.
* Don’t address a person by his or her first name unless you have received permission to do so.
* Do greet with Señor (male), Señora (married female), or Señorita (unmarried female).
* Do shake hands, and always start with the oldest person first.
  * When greeting in social situations, women pat each other on the right forearm or shoulder, rather than shake hands.
* Personal distance is close (1.5 to 4 feet, or 0.5 to 1.2 meters).

### Likes

* Within an enterprise, you will usually find inconsistent technical skill levels. Clear, concise email communication is useful because those communications can be passed along to whomever has the skill and authority to execute various commands.  Technical leaders within businesses will usually have a good facility with the English language.

### Dislikes

* As the market is competitive, sometimes Mexican customers have been over-promised. These customers have high expectations for service and support and it can be challenging to reset those expectations and later, exceed them. 
* Don’t point at a person; doing so is considered disrespectful.

### Best Practices

* In Mexico city, 5 PM rush-hour traffic can be at a stand-still. So, many customers are accustomed to work beyond normal office hours while they wait out the traffic. 

* In Mexico, IT hardware is expensive compared to local labor costs. So, they may to squeeze maximum value from their IT hardware and it is not uncommon to find systems running at capacity limits. These systems  are very actively managed and take advantage of many performance customizations.
