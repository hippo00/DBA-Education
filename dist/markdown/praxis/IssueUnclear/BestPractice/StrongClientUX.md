# The best way to avoid "Client's issue is unclear" is to utilize these methods.

### “A problem well-stated is half-solved”

### Listen for messages beyond words (use your soft skills)
  * Ask questions effectively with what, where, when, what was changed, what client has tried
  * Ask where, and when the issue does NOT occur – this will help further root cause analysis
  * Clarify the problem by restating it in your own words 
  * Understand specific business impacts. Why is this problem important (project schedule slip, users impacted, financial loss)?
  * Start Strong: Know the problem, know the client, build rapport

### Clarify: Define a clear problem statement, and measures of success (root cause analysis, recovery, etc.)
  * Question effectively: What, where, when, when did it start, when/where does it not occur, what have they tried, what changed
  * Understand client impact: what is blocked, how long, # of users impacted, what is business impact
  * See the problem: Use Web sessions early and regularly
  * Personalize: Contact by phone or Webex. Use video conferencing for eye-to-eye communication
  * WebEx meetings let you SEE the environment for configuration, recreate, GUI messages, and understand the client’s pain points
  * Make it Easy: Communicate, anticipate, assist

### Mitigate: Provide workaround while waiting on solution
  * Explain: Why data or configuration change is needed 
  * Hand hold: Assist with collecting data or complex configuration changes when needed
  * Keep informed: Never let client ask for status, keep them informed. Manage client expectations
  * Effectively deliver unpopular messages: Convey difficult messages tactfully﻿
  * Build Rapport: Work "with" the client

### Make it Personal, be more than just “an e-mail address” [support]@ecurep.ibm.com
  * Understand the technical details as well as the human factors
  * CALL the client to 
  * Establish support ownership and build a trusted partnership to resolve the issue
  * Obtain a well-stated problem statement and understand client’s goals
  * Avoid frustration with too many back and forth e-mails
  * Pay attention to the client‘s time zone
