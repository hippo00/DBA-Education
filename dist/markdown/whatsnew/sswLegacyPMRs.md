### Legacy PMRs have been uploaded into SSW
On March 23, we completed the ingestion of legacy PMRs from Wellspring into Support Search with Watson (SSW). This was one of our Q1 commitments and was a highly requested addition to our catalog of documents since the release of SSW. We have extracted 10 years worth of PMRs from RETAIN and they are available now in SSW. If you want to do searches that only include these documents make sure you select ```Doc Type = Support Ticket``` and ```Source = RETAIN``` from the left panel.
