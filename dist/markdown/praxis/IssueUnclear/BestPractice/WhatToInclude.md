# What to include in the Case Record to help clarify the Client's Issue

_To use: Replace the content within with what it is you asking for from the client and/or the update you are making in this Case. Ensure to reread your final version before saving this to your Case update. This is listed as ‘Internal Only’, however you can copy/paste the below into a Case update to the client._

### A Case Record Should Include: 
* Incident/Change record.
* Problem Description/Symptoms.
* Client/User Impact (Was client impacted? Yes or No if yes, describe in business terms).
* Chronology of Events (Including Problem determination and Recovery steps) .
* Outage information (if appropriate).
* Accurate System Reference, Components, and so on (using appropriate fields in the tool).
* Contributing factors.

**'Problem fixed’** is not an appropriate resolution text as it does not provide enough information to understand how the problem was resolved. Instead, you should include:

* Problem Root Cause.
* All actions taken to prevent the problem from recurring (including any actions related to contributing causes). Don't forget documentation (technote, Drupal).
* Permanent Resolution.
