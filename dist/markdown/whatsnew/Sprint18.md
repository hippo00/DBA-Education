## Hardware / Field Service Updates

### General Changes
* Launch on September 8 is a success!  Read the announcement <a href="http://ibm.biz/BdYKUh" target="_blank">here</a>
* The Salesforce Field Service & HW Resource Wiki page with links to procedures and helpful information can be found <a href="http://ibm.biz/BdYSsR" target="_blank">here</a> 
* Salesforce has created a new icon for the Field Service Mobile App.  Documentation for installing the Field Service Mobile App, can be found <a href="https://w3-connections.ibm.com/communities/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=8f0aca92-2010-4a32-914d-77dafc06c9cf#fullpageWidgetId=Wab3fd136e45b_4e42_b8fe_5d1f6bc71bb8&file=359c043f-069f-4c8f-bae6-d7ff9fc86a8c" target="_blank">here</a> 

### Reminder
Special considerations for non-hardware teams when interacting with hardware teams inside Salesforce:
* In this first phase, the Client experience will not change at all; they will continue to open support issues in legacy tools that are then migrated to Salesforce via a behind-the-scenes bridge (referred to as the "Riker bridge").
* Corresponding field service entitlement information will not be available within Salesforce for this first Day 1/ANZ rollout phase. 
* Therefore, it is important for software teams when interacting with hardware, to continue to use existing business processes to engage hardware skills.  Agents should reference the appropriate CRFs and originate cases or tickets in RETAIN/RCMS legacy systems. 
* Implementation of hardware entitlement is planned for Phase 2 / Day 2 encompassing the next-in-line geo.
