### Need to Know Policy
**Version: 3 April 2018**
**Author: Architecture / IT Governance**


This policy is an IBM proprietary document.Â  Distribution in whole or in part outside of IBM requires the approval of the IBM CISO Office. ( IBM Cybersecurity/Poughkeepsie/IBM )


All data on the Salesforce for Support (S4S) platform will be subject to need to know controls. Only those data necessary to accomplish a mission will be available to a platform user.


Data distribution will be kept to a strict minimum. All approved downstream data consumers made privy to any subset S4S data potentially containing PI or client data need to implement the same controls. These consumers may include but are not limited to Watson Discovery Server (WDS) and Case Viewer. With respect to downstreams, an independent Trust Policy Service (TPS) will supplement Salesforce's policy with additional rules to support non-Salesforce users who have a legitimate need to know.


Third parties such as IP Partners who are sent relevant data to perform their contracted jobs are also expected to adhere to a reasonable need to know policy that should be covered in their Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with IBM.
