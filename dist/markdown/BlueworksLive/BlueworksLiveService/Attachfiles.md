## Overview 

There are times when you need to add more definition to an activity in your process blueprint. For example, if you work for an insurance company you may need to define a specific policy. If you work for an educational organization you may need to define specific teaching methods. 

This is when attaching a document to a specific activity becomes very helpful to those using the process blueprint. 

## Component 

Do the following to attach a document to an activity. 

Note: The document should already be created and located on your workstation. 

1.Open your process diagram and enter the Edit mode. 
2.Find the activity you need to attach the document to and open the Properties page. 
3.Click Attachments. 
4.Click Add. A selection box displays allowing you to navigate to where your document is located. 
5.Click on the document you need to attach. The document will automatically upload to the process blueprint and attach itself into the activity box you are working. 

## Troubleshooting
