## Overview 

A process app – process application – is a small application that you can design in Blueworkslive to automate certain types of workflows.  You can build and run two simple types of process apps: workflow and checklist. 

Workflow apps include a sequence of tasks and approval steps that can be assigned to a set of users. Checklist apps include a set of tasks that are assigned all at once and can be completed in any order.

## Troubleshooting 

The following lists some scenarios where a process app can help you in your design phase. 

1.You have designed your process diagram and you need to get it reviewed. You can setup a workflow app that automates the review process completely until completed. A workflow app is sequential so each step of the review must be done before the work flow app will proceed to the next step. All automatically. 

2.You have a list of things that need to be done in a process diagram your team has developed. You can setup a checklist app appointing people to each item in the checklist. Everyone can do this at their leisure.
