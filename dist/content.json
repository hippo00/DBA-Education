This module teaches the basics of installing and troubleshooting BPM/BAW. This module serves as the basis for in-depth education modules on BPM/BAW Installation. \n&nbsp;\n 1) IBM Installation Manager (IIM):\nIBM Installation Manager is a tool that you can use to install and maintain your IBM software packages. Wizards guide you through the steps that you must take to install, modify, update, roll back, or uninstall your IBM products. \nIBM Installation Manager is used to install WAS/BPM binary files. \n\n   How to reinstall Installation Manager without removing installed IBM product \n      http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21290142 \n\n   What are the critical directories that you must back up in case of Installation Manager data loss or corruption?\n      http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665878\n\n   Installing packages by using Installation Manager command line tool (imcl) \n      https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSDV2W1.8.1/com.ibm.cic.commandline.doc/topics/timcl_install.html\n\n   IM log files \n        https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSVJJU6.4.0/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc6.4/cigibmimsdslog_files.html\n\n        the IM log is a xml file you will find it under IMHOME/data/logs i.e 201804041014.xml\n        there are different tags available: \n            Info = Green\n            Warning = Yellow\n            Error = Red\n\n   Using the imcl command to rollback:\n      https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/aimsupport/entry/usingimclcommandlinetorollbackwebsphereapplicationserverfixpacks?lang=en\n\n   KC link to Rolling back packages by using imcl commands:\n      https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSDV2W1.8.5/com.ibm.cic.commandline.doc/topics/timcl_rollingback.html\n&nbsp;\n2. BPM Installation\nEach of the IBM Business Process Manager configurations has its own roadmap to guide through installing and configuring that version of the software\n\nInstallation directories for the product and profiles \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/rinsinstallation_paths.html\n\nDeprecated and removed features \nCheck in the KC for the  \"Deprecated and removed features\" for the specific versions\n\nBPM Software Requirements: \n    Business Process Manager detailed system requirements \n    http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023005\n    IBM Business Process Manager Express detailed system requirements \n    https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023008 \n    Java compatible matrix \n    http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21639640 \n    IBM Business Process Manager Tools & Add-Ons detailed system requirements\n    https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023009\n\nBAW software requirements\n    IBM Business Automation Workflow detailed system requirements\n    https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27051102 \n&nbsp;\n 3. Troubleshoting the BPM / BAW Installation\n\nInstallation and profile creation log files: \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/rinslogfiles.html\n\nMustgather installation / upgrade: \n    Ask for the mustgather as described in this technote\n    http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506937 \n    Ask for the versioninfo: \n       Exporting a versioninfo from install_root/bin/ using\n        versionInfo -fixpacks -ifixes  versioninfo.txt \n        or\n        versionInfo -long  versioninfo.txt\n    Check for the following points:\n        Is configuration described in the problem description supported? \n            Check the software requirement report\n        Is there any errors in the problem description or logs? \n            Search for the error in RTC or Prosol to check if this is a known issue \n\nimportant files to request/review\n    install_root/logs/* -- general installation log files (BPMConfig) \n    Dmgr/properties/service/productDir/* -- configAction log files \n    Dmgr/logs/* -- BPMProfileUpgrade, bootstrapProcessServerData, BPMConfig files \n\nSuccessfull Installation\n    When using IM Graphical mode \n      Launch the Installation Manager GUI, and verify the installation by going to File  View Installed Packages.\n\n    When using imcl command \n      ./imcl listInstalledPackages | imcl.exe listInstalledPackages \n      The output of this command will display a list indicating which packages this Installation Manager has installed. \n      For example: \n\n    When the -log option was used during installation, you can verify that the resulting log file does not contain any errors. \n\nRollback failed\n\n    Most part of the time the problem is:\n\n    There is no installation history anymore. The customer has a new installation of IM and did not make     a backup of his data repository. \n    The data repository is in other path, not in the same as the IM_HOME\n    The data repository is corrupted (in this case only L3 can help) \n\n    Ask for the versioninfo: Exporting a versioninfo from install_root/bin/ \n        versionInfo -fixpacks -ifixes  versioninfo.txt\n\n    Installation Manager (IM) Saved Files for Rollback:\n        Files are saved in the IMShared directory. The default behavior is to save the files for rollback. To view or change this option: \n\n        Using Graphical mode:  File  Preferences  Files for RollBack  Check or Uncheck \"Save Files for RollBack \n        Using console mode:  imcl -c (from IM_HOME/eclipse/tools ) \n        Select \"P\" \n        Select \"3\" \n        Select \"1\" to save or not to save files for rollback\n\n    Questions to ask to the customer \n        if can tell you the product installation History. \n        to see the possible rollback versions run the command imcl listInstalledPackages -verbose\n        to see the versions to which the customer can perform a rollback imcl listInstalledPackages –rollbackVersions \n&nbsp;\n4. iFix Installation:\n\nthe instructions how to install a an ifix is always in the readme file \ncheck if the ifix has a prerequisite, if yes inform the customer\nTechnote explaining how to install an ifix:\n    https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417656\n\nExporting a versioninfo from install_root/bin/ checking it for the iFix number is sufficient: \n   versionInfo -fixpacks -ifixes  versioninfo.txt \n     or\n   versionInfo -long  versioninfo.txt
