## IBM Parts Models - North America


### Options: North America Model and Global Parts Ordering model

**Option 1  - North America remains on - Disbursement Does Not equal usage or ‘Float’**

* Parts Cost Transfer does not occur with disbursement, instead occurs at Case closure process 
* Requires more development for CSP and Global Parts Order Hub ‘GPOH’ and less work for SPO PIMS application
* Madrid UPS FSL is top TSS-SPO priority

* Rough Estimates 
  * CSP = 3 Additional Development Months
  * GPOH = 3 Additional Development Months
  * PIMS = 2.5 Development Months (Impacts: RTS)
  * End to End Testing = 1 Months

  ### Option 2: North America shift to Disbursement equals Usage (Global)
  
* Cost Transfer will occur with disbursement
* Requires more development for SPO PIMS and Global Parts Order Hub ‘GPOH’ and No additional development work for CSP 
* Madrid UPS FSL is top TSS-SPO priority


* Rough Estimates
  * CSP = No Additional Development
  * GPOH = 1 Development Months 
  * PIMS = 4.5 Development Months (Impacts: RTS, Accounting, Planning, Reutilization)
  * End to End Testing = 2 Months
