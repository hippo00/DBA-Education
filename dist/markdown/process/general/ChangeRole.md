#### *Access requests are typically processed once a week. As such, you should expect approval or rejection within 5 business days following your manager's approval of your request. It is our strong recommendation that requests for access are submitted at least 2 weeks in advance to avoid a disruption in your day-to-day working requirements. Please contact your Integration Lead with any quesitons or concerns.*


* **Step-1** : Navigate to <a href="https://w3-03.ibm.com/finance/access/accessReplace.wss" target="_blank">OneTEAM</a>
* Click the radio button next to the environment and role name you'd like to change and then click "Replace"
* In the text box for Business justification, be sure to enter the name of the business unit or product(s) you support and type the following:
 `I am part of [Insert product name] team and I need this tool to execute my day-to-day responsibilities to support IBM customers`
* Click "Continue"
* In the Environment drop-down, select Production for production access or CSP Staging/Training (.STG) for staging/training access. Please note that you will need to submit separate requests per environment if you need access to both production and staging.
* In the Access drop-down, select the role your manager has assigned to you (<a href="/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/usersroles">see here</a>). If requesting access to Production, please verify that you've completed all required training.
* Click "Next"
* Review the information, and then click "Submit for Approval"

#### Please note:
* After submission for approval, your first-line manager will receive notification requesting that they either approve or reject your request. If approved by your manager, the Support Transformation team will review the request and provide final approval or rejection approximately once every business day leading up to and immediately following a schedule migration/rollout, and approximately once every week when no migrations or rollouts are scheduled. It remains our strong recommendation that engineers submit access requests at least 2 weeks in advance of when it's needed to avoid any disruption in their day-to-day working requirements.
* Once initially approved for access to the Cognitive Support Platform, failure to access and work cases or reports in Salesforce for more than 90 days will result in access request deletion and account deactivation. If reactivation is necessary, please follow the instructions above to resubmit. For read-only access, please see <a href="/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/general/accessCM">Case Viewer access instructions</a>.
