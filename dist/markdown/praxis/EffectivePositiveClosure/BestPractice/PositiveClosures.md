# Positive Closures

_Positive Closures are an important part of the case. It is generally the last communication the client receives about the case they opened with IBM. The only other thing they might receive about that case is a survey so it is important that the client is provided with a decent closing statement where they will be inclined to provide feedback. The last ‘touch’ is a nice touch._

**So what are we looking for in the positive closure?**
* Thank the client for using IBM.
* Summarize the problem and the solution crisply.
* Explain how they can reopen the case.
* Indicate that they might receive a survey about their experience with this case and that we would be interested in hearing their thoughts.

**What are some examples that this will help the client?**
* It lets them know the case is closed.
* It gives them an understanding of how to reopen if needed.
* It can be a document that they keep with the solution for their records.
* It shows dedication to our client and our dedication to their issue.
 
**What are some examples that this will help the Support Representative?**
* It has been proven to help increase client satisfaction scores.
* The summary of the case is an added best practice to help Support Representatives to not have to read the whole case to understand what was done to solve the problem.
