# Case Update: Follow-up was via a voicemail

**To use:** _Replace the (....) and the content within with what it is you asking for from the client. Add any additional information that you need to relay to the client. Ensure to re-read your final version before sending to the Client. This is listed as Internal Only, however you can copy/paste the below into an email to the client._

**Action Taken:**

I left a voicemail for **(Client Name)** and advised that I've not heard back from the last interaction **(add any items you specifically asked for such as log files)**. I've asked them to update in this case to confirm if further assistance is needed on this case or if they are ready to close it.

**Action Plan:**

I will attempt the next follow-up in **(#)** days.
