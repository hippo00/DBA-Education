# On-prem Software: How a Client acquires a Support Extension

## Summary
This is for on-prem Software Products. There might be unique situations where a client is not able to migrate to a supported product version before an End of Support (EOS) date. 
 
Be aware that not all on-prem software products and/or versions offer Support Extensions (SE). It is up to the Offering Manager for the product to determine whether a Support Extension will be offered. Support Extensions are offered for varying lengths of time based on a product’s lifecycle. For example, if a product has a 5+3 lifecycle this means it will be "in service" for a minimum of 5 years and will offer a Support Extension for 3 years once the product is removed from "in support". Once a product formally announces that EOS then IBM can start to sell SEs. This document discusses how clients can purchase a SE.
 
Another document, which can help explain and give details on product lifecycle dates, is the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/" target="_blank">"IBM Software Support Lifecycle page"</a>. This page helps to check whether a certain product and version has already reached End of Support. 
 
## From the Clients perspective:
Clients can reach out to their IBM Sales Rep by going to http://www.ibm.com/ page. Scroll to the very bottom and under "Connect with us" locate "Find a sales rep" link then follow the instructions. Depending upon your country, the wording, actual URL links and layout can vary. If the client knows who their Marketing or Account representative this person can also assist them in getting started. 
 
## From Support’s perspective (Internal Use Only):
 
_How to verify a support extension:_
When a Case is entitled, it should check to see whether the client has any support extensions. If the case is non-US, you can always check with one of the Front-End Teams. 
 
Support extensions for various clients can also be viewed using the Special Bid Management Tool, which shows closed, cancelled, and expired support extensions. This is a Lotus Notes database if you cannot access the link below try opening it via the path that is shown, if you still are unable to access then email **Melyssa Moros** with subject line **"Special Bid DB access request"**.

## Steps to obtain a Support Extension
The process does take a bit of time so listing it here so Support Representatives have a better understanding that they can then share with the client. Do not provide this specific list to a client, summarize it.
 
### The following is the high-level flow of the request for a Support Extension through completion:
* Client conveys to IBM the desire to purchase a Support Extension.
* TSS Representative is contacted as TSS sells Support Extensions. Only TSS can sell Support Extensions currently.
* TSS Representative completes the request (e-BiDs, or Special Bids Team contact) with the proper data. 
* The request process notifies the correct parties require to start execution of the bid (Special Bids Team)
* Special Bids Team verifies that the support extension for the requested product is available by checking with the Software Products/Labs.
* If yes, proper Lab Recovery Charges (where applicable), and Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) will be provided to TSS for pricing actions.
* Bid continues through the process to create a complete package for delivery to the client, including a pricing quotation.
