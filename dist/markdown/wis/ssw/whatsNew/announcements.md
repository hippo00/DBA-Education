### Legacy PMRs have been uploaded into SSW
*Tuesday, March 26, 2019*

On March 23, we completed the ingestion of legacy PMRs from Wellspring. This was one of our Q1 commitments and was a highly requested addition to our catalog of documents. We have now 10 years worth of PMR archives extracted from Wellspring available for search. 

### Cases or updates created after March 11 not included in Support Search with Watson (SSW) results
*Thursday, March 21, 2019*

On March 11, 2019 we found issues affecting the formatting of Salesforce tickets in Support Search with Watson (SSW). This was caused by a local setting configuration in the SDS repository, our source for Salesforce tickets. The SDS team is aware of this problem and working to resolve it. While this work is being done we have temporarily paused the extraction of SF tickets from SDS, which means no new tickets or updates to tickets in Salesforce made after March 11 are being shown in SSW. Once the data is corrected in SDS we will reingest all the tickets from SDS. We still donâ€™t have a definitive ETA for completing this work but early estimates indicate this may be completed by the end of March.
