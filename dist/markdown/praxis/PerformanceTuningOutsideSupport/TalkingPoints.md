### How to explain Performance Tuning
This is an example of how to explain to a client that their needs are _Outside of the Scope of Support_, meaning that the assistance requested is not supported by the client’s Support Agreement and will require an IBM Services engagement or support from another vendor.

We want to ensure we provide excellent customer service and thus receive high NPS scores. Practice what you will say to a client before you talk/Webex with your client.

#### Example of how to describe Performance Tuning
Mix and match the following suggestions to match what you need to explain to the client. Add any items specific to the client’s need.

  * Your environment (explain what areas are affected such as software combination, system resources, any code or applications that they have created and so on) is unique, meaning that there is no common set of settings or configurations that work best for all environments.

  * I suggest reviewing the Performance Tuning guide on optimal settings for general usage. Anything beyond the guide requires specialized and in-depth training in areas such 3rd party hardware, software products, open source, network devices, file system, load balancers, firewalls, operating systems, development, customization, and so on.

  * Unfortunately, the support contract and thus support resources do not encompass that level of knowledge and skills. I want to ensure you receive the assistance that you require and let you know that the IBM Service team .

  * IBM Service team is a fee-based service and is not covered in your Support Agreement. Please contact IBM Services https://www.ibm.com/services to view the numerous options and to talk with a consultant for pricing. There is a “Let’s talk” button in the bottom right that provides a list of ways to contact Services including a Live Chat option.
