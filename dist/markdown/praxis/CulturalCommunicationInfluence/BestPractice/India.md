### Below are some general statements of Client Personas, Likes, Dislikes, and Best Practices for working with clients.
 
**Client Personas**
* The docs & links that are provided are not generally followed.
* No good sense of case severity level (every case is Severity 1).
* Tend to escalate issues very quickly.
* Willing to provide (positive) feedback once trust is earned.
* Fell short of time management and commitment (late or no show-up in the conference call or Webex session).

**Likes**
* Most clients like the use of Webex.
* Direct phone calls are preferred other than exchanging information by using emails.

**Dislikes**
* Particularly sensitive to repeat data requests.
* Not a fan of MustGather links
* Complicated technical articles and reference without clear key points.

**Best Practices**
* Data requests OR solution must be clear and straightforward. Webex is recommended other than emails with long list of steps.
* Guide the client to use severity to reflect the real business impact.
* Be patient and embrace uncertainty - keep on reminding the client for critical activities and use highlight in email whenever possible.
* Document everything that is discussed in the meeting and to be clear about who is doing what as follow-up.
