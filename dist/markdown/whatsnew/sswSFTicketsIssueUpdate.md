### Daily updates from Salesforce have resumed
On March 31 we resumed the daily ticket extraction process from Salesforce into Support Search with Watson. This process was stopped on March 11 due to a formatting problem in our source for these documents. All new tickets and modifications created during that period of time have been uploaded and are available in Support Search with Watson. 

### Have questions ?
