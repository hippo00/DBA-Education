## Omni Supervisor Tab



### Agents Tab


There are two views in the Agents tab: All Agents and Agents by Queue.

_All Agents tab_ lets you see the big picture of your agents’ availability, capabilities, capacity, and workload. It’s the default for the Agents tab because it provides the best overall picture of how your agents are doing. Agents logged into Omni-Channel appear in rows, where you can see their status, channels, queues, workload, and capacity.

Select an agent to see Agent Detail and the Agent Timeline to see more nuanced information about how the agent is doing. Agent Detail provides details about an agent’s activity and timestamps. The Agent Timeline displays the agent’s status changes and work via an intuitive calendar view.

_The Agents by Queue tab_ provides information about how well your queues are covered. Every queue that has at least one agent that’s Online or Away is shown. You can see how many agents are assigned to the queue and how many of them are online, away, or idle.

### Queues Tab



You can see your queues’ priority, configured work size, type, and wait times. This information can give you an idea of how efficiently work moves through the queue and to your agents.

### Work Tab



Use the Work Summary view in the Assigned Work tab to get a breakdown of the work that’s in your queues. See the type of work each queue can handle alongside its active work items.
