It unites information process, and users to provide a 360-degree view of work to help drive more successful business outcomes.\n\nWorkflow applications coordinate work between tasks performed by humans and automated tasks to improve daily business operations. Workflow applications have four main components:\n\nAn authoring environment to create and configure the application.\nFrameworks or models for sequencing and delegating work. With Business Automation Workflow, the models can be either structured processes or unstructured cases. You can choose your model based on the pattern of your workflow and not be limited to a case or a process.\nA user experience for interacting with the application. To provide consistent user experiences, standardized workflows can be reused across the organization.\nAdministrative tools for optimizing how the application runs, deploying new versions and managing security.\n\n See how Business Automation Workflow improves the productivity of a new account opening workflow:\n\nIBM BPM Architecture\n\n IBM BPM Key Components\n\nAuthoring tools\n\nIBM Process Designer is the primary authoring tool for business processes; use it to efficiently model and test business processes in all editions of the product. An Business Automation Workflow Advanced deployment environment also includes IBM Integration Designer for building services that are self-contained, or that start other existing services (for example, web services, enterprise resource applications, or applications running in CICS and IMS).\n\nThe Workflow Center repository\n\nThe Workflow Center (aka Process Center) includes a repository for all processes, services, and other assets created in the Process Designer and Integration Designer.\n\nWorkflow Server and runtime environments\n\nWorkflow Server (aka Process Server) provides a single runtime environment that can support a range of business processes, service orchestration, and integration capabilities.\n\nBusiness process administration tools\n\nYou can use a set of administration tools to accomplish tasks ranging from installing and managing snapshots to administering processes and working with the resources in your IT environment, including of Workflow Center Console (aka Process Center Console), Process Admin Console, Business Performance Admin Console, WAS administrative console, etc.\n\nProcess Portal\n\nProcess Portal is the user interface that is provided with all editions of Business Automation Workflow for participating in processes. It can be configured for a single Business Automation Workflow system or federated environments that include IBM Process Federation Server. From Process Portal, users can launch processes, dashboards, and startable services, and work on their tasks.\n\nHands-on Sample Workflow\nIBM Workflow Center includes a complete Hiring Sample process application that you can view and run in IBM Process Designer.\n\nThe instructions for recreating the sample for yourself are in the Hiring tutorial for Process Designer. See Hiring tutorial.\n\nInstructions for running the Hiring Sample process application:\nHiring Sample Overview: The Hiring Sample is included with Workflow Center. The sample introduces the features of Process Designer by showing you how to run a sample process.\nManaging access to the Hiring Sample process application (for administrators): Administrators must provide access to the Hiring Sample process application so that users can view and run the process.\nVerifying access to the Hiring Sample process application: If the Hiring Sample process application is not already available in the IBM Workflow Center Console, you must import it.\nOpening the Hiring Sample process application: To begin running the process in IBM Process Desinger.\nChanging the Hiring Sample: Using the Hiring Sample process application to learn the product. Do not use it as a starting point for your own application because changing this process application might cause errors later.\nPlaying back the Standard HR Open New Position process: Run the Standard HR Open New Position process in the Inspector view in IBM Process Designer to see the process run step by step.\n\n Recommended Badges\n\n<table border=\"1px solid #ccc\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n  \n    <th width=\"15%\" style=\"text-align:center;\";\n    Business Process Manager\n    Business Automation Workflow\n  \n  \n    Basic\n    <a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/zz-en?pageType=badges&id=5bf38a9f-066b-4a46-bca0-67a26e5f7344\" target=\"_blank\"IBM Business Process Manager Introduction \n    \n  \n  \n    Intermediate\n    <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/zz-en?pageType=badges&id=f72abfbd-791f-4d40-89f1-db3bf6c6c490\" target=\"_blank\"IBM Business Process Manager Advanced V8.6 Developer \n    <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/zz-en?pageType=badges&id=e88a39cb-cb86-4deb-8692-0b2ba5c1eea0\" target=\"_blank\"IBM Certified Business Analyst -

When planning a production environment, all stakeholders should be involved in the planning process to create a system that will meet business requirements with respect to data loss tolerance and time to recovery, balanced with costs.\n\n Tools\n\nMany IBM and third-party tools exist for backup and recovery for every component in the production environment. All stakeholders, including networking, systems, storage, database and application teams must work together to create a complete plan that ensures a stable environment and minimizes risk against unplanned outages by using the best set of hardware and software to manage, maintain and test backup, high-availability, and recovery systems.\n\nBackup\n\nBacking up data\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/cadmrecoverybackup.html\n\nBacking up databases\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tinsbackupdatabases.html\n\n Troubleshooting Backups\n\nHigh-Availability (HA)\n\nConsiderations for HADR setup and configuration\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/chadr_considerations.html\n\nBusiness Automation Workflow Workflow with DB2 HADR for Production\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.cloud.vap.doc/topics/rbpmpriclovsppredfconfig.html\n\n Troubleshooting HA\n\nDisaster Recovery (DR)\n\n Troubleshooting DR\n\nWebSphere (WAS)\n\nSince IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) runs on WebSphere Application Server (WAS), you may also need to consider WAS HA and DR, especially if other non-BPM applications are hosted on WAS.

Inside a mediation module there can be one mediation flow component. Mediation flows contain the high-level mediation logic. Mediation flows consist of a sequence of processing steps for\n   Routing communications between services\n   Converting between different transport protocols\n   Transforming message formats between service requestor and provider\n   Handling business events from disparate sources\n\nMediation modules are deployed to Process Server as EAR format.\n\n Prerequisites\nYou should have a basic understanding of below technology.\n\n1.Service Oriented Architecture\nService Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an approach to defining integration architectures based on the concept of a service. Applications collaborate by invoking each other services and services can be composed into larger sequences to implement business processes.\n\n2.Service Component Architecture\nService Component Architecture (SCA) was developed to simplify the integration between business applications and the development of new services. SOA is an abstract way to interpret the services and his correlations, SCA is defined as the implementation of the SOA architecture. Its standards allow the creation of services and the integration between them.\n\n3.Service Module\nService Module is the SCA unit of packaging and deployment.  Service Modules contain one or more Service Components which contain an implementation, and interfaces.\n\n4.Bindings\nBindings identify a specific type of invocation for a service consumer or provider. Bindings can be applied to mediation module imports or exports. Exports let a mediation module offer a service to consumers. Imports let a mediation module access external services (services that are outside the SCA module) in a transparent manner. For more details about Bindings, refer to below topic on BAW knowledge center.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/help_sca/index.html\n\nComponent\n Technical Concepts\n1.Mediation Primitives\nMediation Primitives are the smallest building blocks in mediation flow. They are wired and configured inside mediation flows. They let you change the format, content, or target of service requests; log messages; do database lookups; and so forth.\n\n2.Service Message Objects\nMessages can come from a variety of sources, so the payload has to be able to carry a number of different types of messages. Mediation primitives need to be able to operate on these messages, and service message objects (SMOs) represents the common representation that is needed.\n\nTechnical Articles\n1.Getting Started with WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus\nhttp://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247212.html\n\n2.Strategies for designing error handling in web service mediations\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1108toth/1108toth.html\n\n3.List of mediation primitives\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1108toth/1108toth.html\n\n Troubleshooting\nData Collection\n\n1.To trace the problems that are specific to the Mediation Flow Component and its primitives, below trace string should be enabled on application server:\n=info:com.ibm.ws.sibx.=all:com.ibm.wsspi.sibx.=all:com.ibm.websphere.sibx.=all:com.ibm.ws.sib.processor.utils.UserTrace=all:com.ibm.wbiserver.transform.=all:com.ibm.sr.client.=all\n\n2.Enable Runtime trace dynamically:\nLogon admin console. Under Troubleshooting  Log and Trace, pick the server where you want to change the settings.\nClick Change Log Detail Levels.\nSelect the Runtime tab to dynamically set the tracing and enter the new trace string.\nClick OK to save the changes.\nReproduce the issue and note the time the symptoms occurred.\nInsure the trace covers the time period noted in step four above.\nZip up the profile's logs directory.\nSend us the zip of the logs directory noting any errors, exceptions, or symptoms.\n\n3.Customer should also export their Project Interchange (PI) file. The associated PI file can be exported from IBM Integration Designer (IID) and is very useful to the support team. The file not only describes the application configuration, but it also permits the opportunity for the support team to recreate the problem. PI files have an extension of .zip, but do not need to be unarchived to import into IID.\n\nTo create a PI file, from within IID, complete the following steps:\nSelect File  Export.\nSelect Project Interchange and select the modules which are relevant to your project.\nChoose a file name for the Project Interchange file, and fill it in, in the field at the bottom.\n\nAfter receiving the PI file, support engineer should import it into local workspace within IID:\nSelect File  Import.\nSelect Project Interchange and select the PI file.\n\n Recreating Problem\nAfter importing PI file in IID, using IID testing tools (Test Component):\n1.First insure the test BPM server is started, and the module to test is deployed.\n2.Bring up the test facility :\n\nRight click on the component to test within the Assembly Diagram\nSelect “Test Component”\n\n3.Enter test value(s) provided by the client into the corresponding field(s).\n4.Click the continue button  to start the test execution.\n\nTrace Analyzing\n1.All mediation codes are contained within \".sibx.\"\nExample Exception 1:\ncom.ibm.ws.sca.uow.UOWRolledBackException: caused by: \ncom.ibm.wsspi.sibx.mediation.flow.MediationRuntimeException: com.ibm.ws.sibx.scax.mediation.component.FlowBuildException: CWSXM1006E: Error whilst setting properties of mediation primitive MessageFilter1.

Web service component provides a way for an external system or application to call into BPM. You can use a web service binding in a SCA module to invoke existing web services and expose functionality within the module as a web service. This topic will talk about these web service related components in BPM.\n\n Prerequisites\n\nBelow tutorial will be useful for learning the basics of web services. This is an elementary tutorial that introduces the concepts of web services.\n\nWeb Services Tutorial\nhttp://www.tutorialspoint.com/webservices/\n\nComponent\n\n Outbound Processing\n\nIntegration services enable outbound integration with web services so that processes can retrieve and update data that is stored on an external system. You can use an External Service or a SOAP Connector or a Web Service Integration step to enable the access to the web service.\n\n1.External Service\nYou can create an external service by discovering a web service that is hosted on an external system, and use this external service in a service flow to invoke the web service. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/twebinvoke.html\n\n2.SOAP Connector\nSOAP connector is an embedded integration service, Call WebService via SOAP, is provided in the System Data Toolkit. This connector abstracts the complexity of the web service implementation and requires only minimal configuration. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/tsoapconncall.html\n\nBelow article including many screenshots to introduce how to the SOAP connector to call a web service.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/using-soap-connector-call-web-service-websphere-lombardi-edition\n\n3.Web Service Integration\nUse a Web Service Integration component to invoke a web service that is hosted externally. You can configure the WSDL properties, SOAP header information, authentication, signature and encryption properties for the web service integration. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\n  https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/configuringwebserviceintegration_step.html\n\nInbound Processing\n\nWeb Service component provides a way for an external system or application to call into BPM. You can create a web service component in BPM that you expose to exterior systems so that they can access functionality in an IBM BPM application. The web service component invokes an operation that calls a particular BPM service or service flow. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/creatingexposed_services.html\n\n SCA Component\n\nYou can use a Web Service Binding in a SCA module to invoke existing web services and expose functionality within the module as a web service. A web service binding provides a specification for transmitting messages to and from a web service. You can use a web service import binding to call an external web service to an import. You can use a web service export binding to provide a service to external clients as a web service. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wid.integ.doc/access/topics/cwebbind.html\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n Questions to ask\n\nIs the web service call in question an inbound (a client sending a request to BPM) or an outbound (BPM acting as a client consuming an external web service) call?\nIs there any Web Services security involved (SSL, WS-Security, etc)?\nWas this working in any prior versions of the product (or legacy products)? If so, which version/product was in working in?\nWas it ever working on this version itself?  If so, what has changed (could be backed web service, Business Object structure, authentication requirement, etc)?\n\nVerifying Webservice\n\nAdd ?WSDL to the end of web service URL. Paste the URL into a browser window and you should see something like the following screen shot.\n\n Data Collection\n\n1.To trace the problems that are specific to External Service/Web Service/SOAP Connector/Web Service Integration in BPM, below trace string should be enabled on application server:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Base trace:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=info:WLE.=all:com.ibm.ws.webservices.=all:org.apache.=all:com.ibm.ws.websvcs.=all:com.ibm.ws.metadata.=all\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If you see IOException related to Webservice requests:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=info:WLE.=all:com.ibm.ws.webservices.=all:org.apache.=all:com.ibm.ws.websvcs.=all:com.ibm.ws.metadata.=all:HTTPChannel=all:GenericBNF=all:TCPChannel=all\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If it’s performance related issue or it’s in a production environment, you can use this slighter trace setting:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=info:WLE.wle_outbnd_ws=all:com.ibm.bpm.ws.jaxws.=all\n\n2.To trace the problems that are specific to Web Service Binding in BPM, below trace string should be enabled on application server:\n=info:SCA.=all:com.ibm.ws.webservices.=all:org.apache.=all:com.ibm.ws.websvcs.=all:com.ibm.ws.metadata.=all\n\n3.For Outbound web service issue, the following materials are required.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The WSDL of the actual Web Service (including any included/imported .xsd files)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. A sample response from the Web Service\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The project (see below point 5 for details)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Sample request SOAP message from BPM\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml file from profile configuration directory\n\n4.For Inbound web service issue, the following materials are required.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The SOAP request from the web service client\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The project (see below point 5 for details)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. A sample response SOAP message from BPM (if relevant to problem description)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml file from profile configuration directory\n\n5.Project file\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. For issue of External Service/Web Service/SOAP Connector/Web Service Integration, request the .twx file for the process application as well as the service name in question.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. For issue of Web Service Binding, request the Project Interchange file as well as which import or export component in the project is in question.\n\nRecreating Problem\n\n1.Download SoapUI from https://www.soapui.org/. Install the tool using the default configuration.\n\n2.For outbound calls:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Create new SOAP project and specify WSDL URL in SoapUI.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Generate SOAP mock service. This emulates the customer’s web service so we don’t need direct access to it.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. In web service component in process application, modify the host and port information in WSDL URL to match the mock service. Test scenario to invoke the web service. This is a way to see what BPM actually sends in its request (SoapUI will print out requests received, including HTTP Headers if desired).\n\n3.For inbound calls:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.

The console also provides tools to configure the installed applications.  \n\nTo work with the Process Admin Console: \n\nUse the Server Admin page to perform server administration tasks and view status information for process instances and applications. \n\nUse the Process Inspector page to view and manage process instances for process applications. \n\nUse the Installed Apps page to view and manage snapshots of installed process applications. \n\n Component \n\n1.Server Admin\nWhen the Process Admin Console starts, it displays the Server Admin capabilities. You can perform server administration tasks, user and group management, process and event monitoring in this area. Use the WebSphere command-line administration tool (wsadmin) AdminConfig commands to change the access restriction or grant access to additional users to the listed menu. \n\n2.Process Inspector\nUse Process Inspector to view and manage process instances for process applications that are running on a specific process server. You can use Process Inspector to investigate and resolve runtime problems with process instances. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tadmprocinspector.html \n\n3.Installed Apps \nThe Installed Apps area provides capabilities to administer and configure runtime settings for application snapshots that are installed on a Process Server. \n\nTroubleshooting \n\n Data Collection\n\nIf the issue is related to a user not seeing expected menus in the Server Admin console, collect the following data. \n\n1)SystemOut.log file \n\n2)Output of below command: \nwsadmin -conntype NONE -lang jython -f \\util\\Security\\BPMSecurityConfig_sample.py -E  -g  \nThe console value can be found in the 'Properties' column of Table 2 in link https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/csecconfigproperties.html#csecconfigproperties_pac \nFor example: \nwsadmin -conntype NONE -lang jython -f C:\\IBM\\BPM\\v8.6\\util\\Security\\BPMSecurityConfig_sample.py -E ProcessCenter -g console.manage.caches \n3)For users who cannot access certain control panels, execute the below command in Internet Explorer (IE) and collect the output. \nhttp://[server]:[port]/rest/bpm/wle/v1/user/[userName]?parts=all \nFor example: \nhttp://localhost:9080/rest/bpm/wle/v1/user/deadmin?parts=all \n\nData Analysis \n\nFirst, review the output of wsadmin command as below. \nC:\\IBM\\BPM\\v8.6\\binwsadmin -conntype NONE -lang jython -f C:\\IBM\\BPM\\v8.6\\util\\Security\\BPMSecurityConfig_sample.py -E ProcessCenter -g console.manage.caches \n\nWASX7357I: By request, this scripting client is not connected to any server process. Certain configuration and application operations will be available in local mode. \nWASX7303I: The following options are passed to the scripting environment and are available as arguments that are stored in the argv variable: \"[-E, ProcessCenter, -g, console.manage.caches]\" \n\nCurrent value for property console.manage.caches in DE ProcessCenter is: \nconstraint 0 : tw_admins \nAbove outcome indicates the Manage Caches menu is only visible for group tw_admins. \n\nNext, check the membership definitions in the REST result. The result should contain below definition if the user wants to see the menu. \ntw_admins \nOtherwise, client should change the access restriction and grant proper access to the user by using wsadmin AdminConfig command as described in below article. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/csecconfig_properties.html \n\n Reference \n\nCollect
