## Overview

A MetaBot is one of the three types of bots that you can use to automate a process. The other two types are TaskBot and IQBot.  A MetaBot can be created based on an application API, visual captures, or  Integration Flow.  MetaBots are automation building blocks that can be used and re-used in a wide variety of automated tasks.  MetaBots are app resilient and can be calibrated to adjust to any changes and updates in the application being automated. MetaBots do not work on their own; they must be called or initiated from TaskBots.
