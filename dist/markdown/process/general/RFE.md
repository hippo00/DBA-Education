You can also get notifications on any new ideas submitted. 
To receive those notificatations: 
* Open Salesforce to the Chatter tab. 
* Click Groups and search for the group Salesforce New Ideas
* Join that group

Then you can modify how often you receive notifications for that group.
* Click your user icon in the upper right corner of the scren and select My Settings
* Select Chatter - Email Notifications
* Select the frequency of updates for your groups. You can receive notifications on each post, a dialy digest, a weekly digest or notifications only when you are mentioned.

## Integration lead role

Integration leads play an important part in the Ideas process. For critical ideas, make sure to inform your integration lead of the idea. Integration leads meet regularly to review high priority ideas and nominate them to be submitted to the PPO team. 

## Process and Product Owner review

A key element of the Ideas process is a review by the process and product owner team. They review ideas each sprint and decide to move them into the funnel. The criteria for determining what items should be moved includes (but is not limited to):
* The number of votes on the idea
* Alignment with the dba-support/Opel vision
* Applicability to all users
* Alignment with other plans on the plaform
* Benefit to the users - either customers or agent
