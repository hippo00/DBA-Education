# Thailand

### Primary Belief Systems
* 95% of population is Buddhist
* Most people devout and attend the temple regularly
* Northern tribes also practice animism
* Most Thai houses have a spirit house presenting offerings to the spirits

### Thai Mindset
* Saving face is important
* Enormous respect for the Royal Family
* Modest and devout Buddhists
* Proud of Thailand and its natural beauty

### Key Points
* Thais are famous for their smiles. The Thai smile can say many things. Thais smile when they are happy, amused, embarrassed, uncertain, wrong, annoyed or furious. It is important , therefore, not to misread it and to use your judgement of the context to read this aspect of body language.
* Be aware of the importance of relationships first. Relationships develop slowly so be patient and demonstrate you are prepared to invest time and people in trust-building.
* Remember Jai Yen (keep a cool heart) -avoid open displays of anger and impatience (looking at your watch, cutting inon a conversation) which traditionally, would be seen as spiritually ugly.
* Smile and be tactful. Thais are raised to be polite and subdued. The softer, more subtle approach is best.
* Thais place great value on outward forms of courtesy such as politeness, respect and self-control in order to maintain harmonious relationships.
* It is a non-confrontational society in which many Thais find it difficult to say "No" or report bad news to seniors. You need to be aware of non-verbal signals and use local connections to help you probe beneath the apparent surface harmony.
* Take account of "Thai time". Life is cyclical, time is fluid and the concept of time remains attached to the unhurried, repetitive framework of agriculture. Non-Thais should take care not to confusethis "slowness" with laziness or apathy.
* Building a good relationship is an important part of the negotiation process, so don't be afraid of simple conversation, normally at either the start or end of your 'official' presentation. Thais place a lot of importance on 'liking' a person, and never underestimate this. Invitations to activities such as golf, dinner, and other functions should always be accepted and seen as an opportunity to get to know each other.
* Remember to show total respect for the King and the Thai royal family. Never criticise them. Don't criticise your own royal family, either (if you have one); Thais will not understand this lack of respect.
* Although they are modest and unassuming, Thais, particularly those of Chinese descent, can be tough negotiators. Thai-Chinese often like to gamble and are more inclined to take risks than ethnic Thais.
