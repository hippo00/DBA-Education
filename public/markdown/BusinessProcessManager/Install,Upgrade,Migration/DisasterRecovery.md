# Backup, High Availability, and Disaster Recovery

## Business Automation Workflow (BAW) / Business Process Manager (BPM)

### Strategy

Backup and recovery planning depends on business requirements. When planning a production environment, all stakeholders should be involved in the planning process to create a system that will meet business requirements with respect to data loss tolerance and time to recovery, balanced with costs.

### Tools

Many IBM and third-party tools exist for backup and recovery for every component in the production environment. All stakeholders, including networking, systems, storage, database and application teams must work together to create a complete plan that ensures a stable environment and minimizes risk against unplanned outages by using the best set of hardware and software to manage, maintain and test backup, high-availability, and recovery systems.
