### Entitlement Policy
#### Agent and Customer Experience

#### #IBM’s Policy= Foster our customer relationship through trust and transparency
Do we have an existing relationship with this customer? Support them first, then verify the relationship in parallel.

**What’s changing?**
We already value our customer relationships so how are we improving? We will leverage the Cognitive Support Platform to vastly improve linking our customers to their support agreements, automate common entitlement checks, and display service contract information.

Ok, but how?
Please note, these are strategy statements, some not yet implemented. Please reference DBA-Education release notes for information.
*  We will check the user’s IBMid (email address domain) against all accounts with that email domain name for support agreements. Combined with Registration 2.0, we will address the #1 root cause for entitlement problems (linking the customer to their account containing the support contract).
*  The system will check for premium agreements and set the appropriate milestones (response times) and inform the right IBM team members (e.g. AVLs for AVP) if an entitlement issue arises. 
*  Upon case submission, the system will check product version, end of support and support extensions, and support agreements for the best entitlement.
*  We will display service contract information (type and end date) on the support website so the customer knows which contract they’re case applies to.

**Customer experience**
This is the best part! Our customers will save time because they will no longer need to:
*  Find the right ICN 
*  Contact an IBM to associate them to their accounts 
*  Call across their IBM Contacts to fix entitlement issues 
*  Engage their site technical contact (whom they usually have to find) to create ICN associations 
*  Know IBM’s inner-workings trying to obtain support because of ICN linkage issues 
*  Escalate issues to receive support because of entitlement issues.

*Transparency!* If the user selects a product for support with an expired agree mentor end of service version, they will
be notified that Sales/renewals will be in contact with their company. We will display names and emails
so the user knows who is working on the agreement. We believe displaying this information will speed renewal negotiations and give the user a better experience.

**Support Agent experience**
A prime objective of this policy and improvements is to remove entitlement from the agent’s vocabulary. Our agents can focus on their goal to solve problems, connect with our customers to troubleshoot and resolve the issues. We’re removing entitlement from the conversation, the system will take care of it.

**Agent power!** We will design the system to allow agents to see account entitlements and related opportunities when applicable to make up to the minute support decisions. Our support agents are the frontline and may have up-to -the-minute relationship information superceeding the system’s knowledge.

**Partner experience**
Partners will either use their Partner Direct login or IBMid and receive the same experience described above for our customers. We will need to ensure that partners can select the right customer to ensure they’re supporting the intended customer.

**Sales experience**
If the system finds an expired agreement or end of service product without a service extension, it will create an ‘opportunity’ and route it to the right Sales or Renewal team.

**Service Planner experience** 
The goal here is that Product bundling will be managed solely via the ETL Admin Tool and product versions managed via the Service Console ensuring consistent information for all using the system and one system of management and record.

**Target Timeline**
The Digital Entitlement work stream team and the Cognitive Support Platform teamare working together to prioritize and deploy entitlement framework and experience in waves. Keep an eye on the ‘what’s new’ section of the DBA-Education for updates.

In summary, Q4-2018 is focused on capabilities which allows us to begin vetting the results before customer experience and agent work flow capabilities are implemented. We are targeting Q1-2019 for customer experiences in staging. How does phone support fit into the strategy?

We are working with call receive and exception handling leaders to merge the digital experience with the live handling experience early 2019. Call receive agents and exception handler agents will use the Cognitive Support Platform when assisting clients.

**What about HW, Field Service, and Appliance Entitlement?**

Q4, 2018 MVP work for entitlement covers SW agreements: 
Passport Advantage, Passport Advantage Express, Flexible Contract, Distributed Appliance Program, SWMA Not System Entitled, SWMA Including Premium and their premium offerings such as AVP. We are in the planning phase for HW, Field Service, and appliances with appliances first and will publish process and experience updates here as we get closer to MVP for them.

**How can I provide feedback?**
Your brand Transformation Leader is invited to the bi-weekly entitlement showcase where they can ask 
questions and bring concerns.
