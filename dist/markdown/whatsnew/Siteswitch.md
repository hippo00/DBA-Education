## Salesforce Maintenance Outage Planned for Sunday, January 20 

On Sunday, January 20, there will be a planned Salesforce maintenance period which will result in a short disruption of service between 12:00 AM and 12:15 AM US Eastern time. Regular maintenance ensures the continued performance of our Salesforce instance.
During this time, the Service Console and IBM Support Community will be in **read-only mode**. If your clients experience a Sev 1 issue during this time, please direct your US based customers to call 1-800-IBM-SERV. Contacts for global clients are available <a href="https://www.ibm.com/planetwide/index.html#region" target="_blank">here.</a>
Please join the <a href="https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C902QFMPG" target="_blank">#csp-announcements</a> Slack channel for real-time updates. To join, use the Search feature in the upper right corner of the Slack application.
