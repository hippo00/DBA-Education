# Software only: Support Lifecycle

#### What is a Software Support Lifecycle Policy?
The IBM Software Support Lifecycle policy specifies the length of time support will be available for IBM software from when the product is available for purchase to the time the product is no longer supported. IBM software clients can use this site to track how long their version and release of a particular IBM software product will be supported. Using the information on this site, clients will be able to effectively plan their software investment, without any gaps in support.

#### Where to find a product’s lifecycle?
The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/home/pages/lifecycle/" target="_blank">Support Lifecycle</a> page allows the user to find detailed information about the available IBM Software Support Lifecycle Policies to help our clients to realize the full value of your IBM software products.

#### What are the Policy Types?
The policy type indicates which lifecycle applies to each version and/or release of a product. Products must advise the Policy Type/Lifecycle in the official product announcement letter. IBM may modify these policies at any time, and will communicate the modification and any exceptions via a product announcement letter or in a general policy announcement.

* Continuous Delivery (“C”) is developed via Agile methodology so it normally doesn’t have an End of Support date.
* Standard (“S”) is mostly used with on-prem software and is a 3+2, meaning it will be supported for a minimum of 3 years and will offer 2 years of Extended Support where the client must purchase a separate Support Extension in order to qualify for support.
* Enhanced (“E”) is mostly used with on-prem software and is a 5+3, meaning it will be supported for a minimum of 5 years and will offer 3 years of Extended Support where the client must purchase a separate Support Extension in order to qualify for support.
* Other (“O”) is used on any product that doesn’t have one of the above three policy type. The duration for in support years and extended support period (if any) are offered at the software lab’s discretion. These will be defined and listed in detail in the product announcement.

#### What is a Support Extension?
Support Extension provides support for a specific version of a product that has reached its End of Support (EOS) date. Support Extensions are usually governed by the Software Support Lifecycle policy.
