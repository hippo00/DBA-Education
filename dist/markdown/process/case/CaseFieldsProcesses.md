### Description
Beginning with Sprint 19, this field will no longer be checked by automated processes â€“ it will be updated by users through the UI only. When checked, the red arrow will still continue to appear next the case number. When unchecked, the red arrow will still continue to disappear.

Like before, checking the Escalated checkbox will send an escalation email to the escalation team members on the support mission the case is associated with.

## <a id="mwarning" name="mwarning"></a>Milestone Warning

| Characteristic         |                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Data Type              | Boolean                                |
| Client Visible         | no                                     |
| On Case Page Layout    | yes, read-only                         |
| On Case View Layout    | yes ([how to use it on case views](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/case/fields#filterLogicBoolean)) |
| Related Processes      | tbd |

### Description
This new checkbox field will be populated by an automated process 30 minutes before the milestone target date is reached. This is not updateable by users and will be locked down. Once checked, the Milestone Warning field will remain checked. It will be positioned under the Escalated checkbox in order to keep escalation-related fields near each other. The escalation email alert that fires 30 minutes before a milestone is breached will continue to be sent out. Please note that these email alerts are sent in batches from Salesforce, and there could be a slight delay depending on when in the batch the Milestone Warning field becomes checked. Although the Milestone Missed checkbox will become checked 90 minutes into a Milestone, the email alert sent to the Escalation Teams are only for Severity 1 cases. 

Please note: Posting an *external* post on the case will stop the milestone timer
