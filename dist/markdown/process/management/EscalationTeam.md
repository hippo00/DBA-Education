The Escalation Team can be configured on the Support Mission and is used for a number of events that cause attention of the Leadership team of the Mission. An Escalation team is essentially a list of eMail addresses which can represent **individual users**, **a group of people** (e.g. a slack channel with slack email address), or a **pager duty** email address.

## Configure the Escalation Team

* Navigate to your Support Mission to view/add/edit Escalation Team members
* Use the 'Add to Escalation Team' action to add a member
