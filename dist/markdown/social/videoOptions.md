## Which type of video creator are you?
IBM offers two video production products to choose from for creating externally published videos.  The tool choice you make depends on what level of expertise you have or want to achieve. The content below briefly describes the two options and attempts to help you decide which is best for your intended use.



### ViewletBuilder Professional

ViewletBuilder is the recommended tool if:
* You are new to video recording
OR
* You just want an simple way to record screen-shots, put in some on-screen captions and send your project to your business units video publishing team for voice-over and post production.  You can also use this tool to produce a completed product if you choose to do so.  It does have the functionality to produce quality finished products.

### Camtasia

Camtasia is the recommended tool if:
* You have some experience with recording
OR
* You like to be creative and perhaps do your own voice narration for the video.  You would like to be able to edit the video after recording it to make sure everything is good before sending it to your business units video publishing team.

Regardless of which product you choose, make sure you have a licensed version of the product (if applicable) before you start your recording!
