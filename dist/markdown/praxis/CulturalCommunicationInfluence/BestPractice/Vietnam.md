### Key Points
* Learn the basics of Confucianism and respect it, as it governs all social transactions.
* The family is the most important element ofsociety and extends well beyond blood relatives to business colleagues and one's own personal network.
* Make a point of studying Vietnamese history, even if it is not likely to come up in conversation. It will help you to put the Vietnamese and their attitude to life in perspective.
* Do not patronise your Vietnamese counterparts. They may have lagged behind the rest of Asia, having been embroiled in conflict for so long, but they are entrepreneurial, hard-working and clever in business.
* Develop a sense of patience. Everything takes much longer here and time is regarded as an infinite commodity. Take time to chat to people in markets, get to know your employees and expect decision-making to be protracted.
* Remember that it is essential at all times to allow others to save face. Do not put somebody in a position where they are likely to lose face, for example, being unable to answer a question.
* Show respect for older people at all times and be very careful how you talk about your own ancestors and other peoples',as the Vietnamese practise ancestor worship.
* Bear in mind that Vietnamese people can be suspicious of foreign investors and even have trouble trusting one another. This is why personal relationships in business are so important.
* Building in time for business entertaining, which is an important part in forming a relationship.
* The originally Chinese art of feng shui, or geomancy, is practised in Vietnam, where it is known as Dai Ly. It may be necessary for the sake of the workers to have a new building or project blessed by the local feng shui man.
