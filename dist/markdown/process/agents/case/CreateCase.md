## <a id="utility" name="utility"></a>Create a Case using the Utility Bar
* Navigate to the Utility Bar at the bottom of the screen
* Notice the **Create Case** button as indicated in the screen capture below

<img width="1278" alt="screen shot 2019-05-15 at 3 07 04 pm" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/156294/files/4a43dc00-7724-11e9-8146-109f5316dbe5">

After you select the button to create a case, a window opens.  If needed, you can expand the window before making selections.  

*Warning: If you expand the window after making selections, the workflow will refresh and start over.*

The Global Search works across specific records and there are hints available to help with the search request. 

Global search returns records sets, and groups them by Serial Numbers (Assets), Products, Contacts and Accounts.  You can refine the results by adding to the search criteria.  

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/ee8bcc80-7ca8-11e9-831b-8221b0c0af07)

You can click the top of the columns within a record set to re-order the records, and use the list navigation (First, Prev, Next, Last) to move through the records returned. 
 
 You can expand under the Product listing to show Product Areas (as applies).  If you select a Product Area, the platform will select the related Product.  Searching is also enabled for these Product Areas.

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/0400f680-7ca9-11e9-8c14-676ed7a2d080)

Select one record from all the records sets returned.  The order of the results is purposeful, with Products allowing for the smoothest path forward.   

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/10854f00-7ca9-11e9-9c6b-3c6d7588758d)

**Note:** If you select a Product that has not been boarded an error message will display with a description and a link to the target web page for the product, which the client should go to for support.

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/21ce5b80-7ca9-11e9-910d-dae42c6bc647)

Once you have selected the Product, select the case Severity and complete any Must Gathers that are required before Account Selection.  Inputs appearing on this screen are used to factor Account’s entitlement. 

Search for the Contact and select it to add to the case.  You can search on contact details or account name.  

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/2d218700-7ca9-11e9-94b4-e0d9763949da)

The Select Account page displays the Accounts that are associated with the Contact that you selected but you can also search for Accounts outside of that list.  Entitlement information displays in the results.  

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/3ad70c80-7ca9-11e9-8a62-9c8dfdfdcac8)

Click Previous to move to a previous selection.  The platform remembers your selections as you progress through the pages again. 

Once you have made all of your selections you will be directed to the Case Details screen.  

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/49252880-7ca9-11e9-8f2f-2db030f8a0c4)

Complete the subject, description, and other required fields that have an asterisk.  After you complete the fields, select Save. 

The platform creates the case and a wait screen appears.  When the case processes Watson is called,  an Entitlement is calculated, and the case is Routed and Assigned.  

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/5e9a5280-7ca9-11e9-84bd-5e2aa0ab9792)

Previously, there was a 4-6-minute delay in the mission team routing and assignment of the case.  With the release of this process, the routing and assignment is synchronous.   

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/6c4fd800-7ca9-11e9-8243-da0b3c190d13)

On the final screen, you see all the input details of the case, as well as the mission team and owner.

Clicking on the Case Number will open the new Case in a new tab.


Once the case has been created, the Product, Account and Contact can be edited by selecting the Edit Primary Fields tab.  Select the Product, Account, Contact, or any combination of the three.

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/7d004e00-7ca9-11e9-9c5f-966ef56d710d)

Edits can still be made in the left column but using this function could cause data integrity issues with Routing, Assignment, and Entitlement. Information icons will direct users to the Edit Primary Fields tab.


![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/87bae300-7ca9-11e9-92a0-15b8a31990b6)

If you select Contact, the Next button will take you to the screen to search for a new contact. You can search for a new contact or select one from the provided list.

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/93a6a500-7ca9-11e9-9e31-211030daad8d)


Selecting product and/or account will take you to the screen to search for a new Product or select one from the provided list.  

Once the Product is entered, the Next button brings you to additional questions about the case, including the severity and version.

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/9d300d00-7ca9-11e9-947f-cfc64fbad37f)


Next, use the selected Account or search to find a new Account.

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/ad47ec80-7ca9-11e9-9b13-0e74a7007019)

Finally, the Next button brings you to a review page, where you will see your selections.  The Save button processes the updates and refreshes the case fields.

If you have modified the Product or Account, you may also see updates for the Support Mission, Mission Team, Case Owner and Entitlement.


There are two additional ways to launch the Case Create flow.  The Duplicate Case button on the Open and Closed case record types will launch the flow and feed in the Product, Account, and Contact from the original case. 

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/bc2e9f00-7ca9-11e9-8184-a534396e0c9f)


The new Case will inherit the values of the original case for Account, Contact, and Product:

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/c5b80700-7ca9-11e9-886d-c7e0b2e20f2d)

All additional values will need to be input as if a new case.

Once the case is saved, the new case number will appear in the Wait Screen as well as the resulting completed screen:

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/cfda0580-7ca9-11e9-8323-9d8b4b4de931)


Clicking the link on the Case Number will open a tab with the new case record:

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/dec0b800-7ca9-11e9-9e56-b42eb09ff424)



For Closed cases, the new case created will be Open with status of New Case.

Finally, the Case Create flow will be launched from the Live Chat Transcript page when Agents need to create a Case related to a recent chat.  The flow will launch and feed in the Product, and Contact from the chat record.

On a Live Chat Transcript record page, view the Attached Case related to the chat, or click the New Case tab to launch the flow. 

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/ec763d80-7ca9-11e9-8cce-a882da43e27f)


The Contact and Product will be pre-selected in the Case Create flow. All additional values will need to be input for the new case.

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/f6983c00-7ca9-11e9-81b3-25b2d1d8b82c)


Once the new Case is created, it will be related to the Live chat Transcript record and appear in the Attached Case tab:

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/129959/files/031c9480-7caa-11e9-934c-dbb86ea55ad3)
