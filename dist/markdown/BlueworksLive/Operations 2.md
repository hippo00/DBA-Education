4.How is security implemented inside Blueworks Live? 
Blueworks Live does regular security testing and audits, using a mix of manual penetration testing and automated scans, following IBM policies and practices.

In addition we participate in ISO compliance (27001, 27017, 27018) assessments which assess our security practices.

Our security description can be found here: https://us001.blueworkslive.com/scr/docs/bwl/topics/security_practices.html#security_policy.
 
Note: We're not in the practice of providing details about what is or is not tested; doing so would be a security exposure in itself. But we can certainly provide a copy of our last independent pen test report, which describes the test methodology used.
