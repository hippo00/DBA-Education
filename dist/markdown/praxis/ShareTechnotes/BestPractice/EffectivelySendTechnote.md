# How to effectively send a Technote to a Client

### How to effectively send a a technote or knowledge center article to a Client
It is never a good idea to e-mail a client a technote or knowledge center article ‘explicitly’ before making your first contact with the client. We want to ensure we are providing excellent customer service and in return receive higher NPS scores.

#### Here are a few examples of the negative side effects which can quickly bring down the client’s overall impression of IBM Support and lead to poor NPS.
* Clients do search for answers before opening a case with IBM. Don’t make the client feel like they try or were too lazy not to find it before opening the case.
* It give the impression that your time is more valuable than theirs and you are giving them a ‘brush off’.

When providing a technote or knowledge center article to a client ensure you summarize the steps they should complete. If you are asking for additional data or files these should be listed and you should advise the client why you are asking for the files. If they understand how it fits into helping them resolve the issue they are more likely to complete the requested tasks.

#### Keep in mind the following items in efforts to provide the best support experience to the client, especially at initial contact:
* Be attentive to the problem described, this needs to be confirmed to ensure a clear statement of the real issue
* Communicate to the client that you have an understanding of the issue
* Review the document on your own for your understanding
* Depending on the content of the document, provide any of the following to client:
* Explicit instructions
* Brief overview of the steps
* Highlight the relevant section that addresses the client’s particular issue
* Provide reasoning to the benefits of the document and how its tailored to the client's issue (i.e. similar symptoms described, useful tracing for additional investigation, steps relevant to current case, etc)
* Offer a Webex session to assist with implementation if necessary
* Encourage the client to ask any questions or obtain clarification on the document

#### IF you have talked with the client and reviewed the technote
* You can now supply a technote or knowledge center article link
* After reviewing the document with the client once, it’s okay to reference the document just as a link for follow ups in the event the client needs reminding of its content.

#### IF you are unable to talk/Webex with the client
* It is better to provide the client with a high-level description of the steps and why they are necessary to solve the reported problem. That way, when the client follows the technote, even though it’s not tailored to their issue they have an easier job putting the pieces together.

For the more lengthy technotes, always point to (or highlight) the relevant section of the document that addresses the client’s particular issue. It is more helpful to narrow down to exact steps the client needs (such as stating ‘follow steps 5-12’ or other specific reference within a larger technote). If you provide more than one a technote or knowledge center article clearly numerate the order in which they are to be completed. This additional level of clarity has been shown to improve NPS.

Lastly, always check whether there are other (more social) resources to support the technote. IBM Support has had very good success providing links to IBM Knowledge Centers, videos, and blogs to clients to address known issues.
