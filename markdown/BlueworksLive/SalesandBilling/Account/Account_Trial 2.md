## Overview 

All Blueworks Live accounts (IBM internal and client paid) begin as trial accounts. 

## Component 

**IBM Internal** 
Once a trial account is opened you must go to the suadmin and convert that trial to a full account. 

**Client Paid** 
Once a trial account is opened, the sale representative contact the appropriate IBM Project Office and together they negotiate the client contract with the project office provisioning the account. 

The IBM Project Office email are listed on the Support Wiki: https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W415e0ec58a85_4b75_b9d4_f172a6e1e57d/page/Billing%20Issues%20and%20Billing%20Team%20Contacts
