Hi **(Client Name)**,

This is **(Support rep name)** from the IBM **(Product)** Technical Support. I have been reviewing your case and am not clear on the issue you are reporting. (Selection from options listed, first try getting with the client via phone or Webex so you can talk through the issue, this is the faster route and is encouraged.)

I would like to schedule a **(call or Webex)** with you to review the issue you are reporting to ensure we provide the best solution for your business. (Suggest either a date/time or ask them to make a suggestion or give them your contact information listing dates/times you are available.)

(If you aren't available during the client's work hours try to obtain clarity via email. Review the documents under **Best Practices** (https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/praxis/issueUnclear/bestPractice) in **Praxis** for more ideas on what to ask.)

The current issue is listed as **(list what is currently known)**. I have reviewed the case and the documents provided at this point (if any documents have been provided). I have some questions that I believe will help clarify this issue.

(1) What are the symptoms of the problem?

(2) Where does the problem occur?

(3) When does the problem occur?

(4) Under which conditions does the problem occur?

(5) Can the problem be reproduced?

(6) What recent changes, if any, could be affecting the current behavior?

(7) What are you observing vs what you are expecting to occur?

(8) What other concerns are those issues creating?

(9) Collect environment specifications (OS, product versioning, fix pack level, etc)

Add any additional questions you feel are relevant. (Add anything else that you believe will help clarify the issue. It's suggested not to ask for more files until you clarify the issue.)

I will check back in **(#)** days, however if you make an update to the case before that time I will be able to provide assistance sooner.

Thank you for using IBM!

**(Support rep’s name)**
