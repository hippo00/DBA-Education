# Client is not responding (Communication Rule) - What to do if a client has stopped responding

While managing your cases and workload you will notice that there are times where a client seems to have disappeared as they are no longer responding. There can be many reasons for this ‘disappearance’ such as:
  * The client may be on vacation or have a personal / family issue
  * The client may be working on more pressing business need on their side
  * The client may be helping others with high priority issues

Try alternative ways of contacting them such as phone, e-mail, case updates. Use all three methods before considering to closing the case.

#### Phone
One of the best ways to try and reach the client is to pick up the phone. If they don’t answer, they may say in their voicemail greeting that they are out of the office or provide another insight into why they are not responding to your request. Include the following in voicemail:
  * Your name and that you are from IBM
  * Case #
  * Summary of Issue
  * List any documents you are waiting to receive or steps they should be working through
  * The Date of your next follow-up
  * Ask them to update the Case
  * Propose a date/time for a phone call

If the client is non English-speaking, contact an IBM support colleague in the client’s local country and ask them to attempt to contact this client. This is to allow the client the opportunity to discuss with a local support engineer in their own language any issues that they may be experiencing. See if there is a local (in-country) IBM Account team that can assist in contacting this client.

#### Email
Ensure you have the correct email address, if it bounces back check other cases that the contact has opened in recent history to see if there is another email address. Include the following in the email:
  * Case #
  * Summary of Issue
  * List any documents you are waiting to receive or steps they should be working through
  * The Date of your next follow-up
  * Ask them to update the Case
  * Your name in the signature

Any e-mail communication with the client should use the ECuREP e-mail function or the Cognitive Support Platform client e-mail function.

#### Case Update
Create an update to the case. Include the following:
  * Summary of the Issue
  * List any documents you are waiting to receive or steps they should be working through
  * The Date of your next follow-up
  * Ask them to update the Case

Check that the client contact information is correct. If unsure, check older cases by doing a search for the customer number and see if there are alternate client contacts to be found. If the case is from an enterprise client, check with the client contract manager to see if alternate contacts are known. Contact the IBM Account team for this client. They may have alternate contacts or contact details. Ensure that you take note of any Out-Of-Office responses and voicemail messages and log these.

#### Case Closure
If all of this has been done we would start the ‘Case Closing’ procedure. Update the case to reflect WHEN contact was attempted (list all dates) and HOW contact was attempted (telephone w/ voicemail, case update, email) per attempt. It needs to be very clear that numerous methods were used to try to contact the client.
