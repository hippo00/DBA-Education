### Below are some general statements of Client Personas, Likes, Dislikes, and Best Practices for working with clients.

**Client Personas**
* Limited technical skill and product knowledge; more likely impacted by the complexity of the product
* More focus on resolving the issues other than root cause analysis.
* The clients are more sensitive to the time we take to resolve their problems despite the low severity
* Generally cope well with English; however make sure speak slowly and clearly.

**Likes**
* Clear commands / actions and delivered in a form that easy to understand.
* Webex to guide step-by-step (or using screen captures or diagrams).

**Dislikes**
* Deep and complex technical discussions and steps.
* Complicated expressions.

**Best Practices**
* Use Webex and provide direct instructions.
* Do NOT use SLA (Service-level Agreement) that defines when we "must" follow-up for low severity cases.
* **Note:** Most ASEAN clients tend to open cases with a low Severity; however we should never tell clients "Since you have a Severity three case, I only need to update you once a week‚Äù.
* If you deal with the client team as a whole, treat the team as a single unit and deal with the most senior person possible.
