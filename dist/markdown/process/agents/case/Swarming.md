## Working with a Skill Case
You may be sent a Skills Case when assistance is needed from an SME by the owner of Client Case.  Skills Cases are internal, the client will not have visibility to the Skills Case.
### Assignment of Skill Cases
Assignment of Skills Cases will depend on your teams Assignment Method Reference <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/case/agents/caseAssignment" target="_blank">here.</a>
 
### Identifying a Skill Case
Skills Cases are identified by the Knowledge Icon and "SME" flag in the Case Header. Note that the Parent Case is listed and not the Client Account or Contacts.

## Communication between Skill Case and Parent Case
Reference: <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/communication" target="_blank">Communicating in a Case</a>


### Closing Completed work on a Skill Case
Skill Cases are automatically Closed when the Parent Case is closed.
As a Skill Case owner, once you have completed your work against the Skill Case you can; 

- Update the Status to SME Work Complete
- Close the Skill Case  (it is not required that it stay open pending Parent Closure)

DO NOT send the Skill Case back to the Owner/Support Mission of the Parent Case. These should remain with the assigned owner for tracking and metric purposes.
