It unites information process, and users to provide a 360-degree view of work to help drive more successful business outcomes.\n\nWorkflow applications coordinate work between tasks performed by humans and automated tasks to improve daily business operations. Workflow applications have four main components:\n\nAn authoring environment to create and configure the application.\nFrameworks or models for sequencing and delegating work. With Business Automation Workflow, the models can be either structured processes or unstructured cases. You can choose your model based on the pattern of your workflow and not be limited to a case or a process.\nA user experience for interacting with the application. To provide consistent user experiences, standardized workflows can be reused across the organization.\nAdministrative tools for optimizing how the application runs, deploying new versions and managing security.\n\n See how Business Automation Workflow improves the productivity of a new account opening workflow:\n\nIBM BPM Architecture\n\n IBM BPM Key Components\n\nAuthoring tools\n\nIBM Process Designer is the primary authoring tool for business processes; use it to efficiently model and test business processes in all editions of the product. An Business Automation Workflow Advanced deployment environment also includes IBM Integration Designer for building services that are self-contained, or that start other existing services (for example, web services, enterprise resource applications, or applications running in CICS and IMS).\n\nThe Workflow Center repository\n\nThe Workflow Center (aka Process Center) includes a repository for all processes, services, and other assets created in the Process Designer and Integration Designer.\n\nWorkflow Server and runtime environments\n\nWorkflow Server (aka Process Server) provides a single runtime environment that can support a range of business processes, service orchestration, and integration capabilities.\n\nBusiness process administration tools\n\nYou can use a set of administration tools to accomplish tasks ranging from installing and managing snapshots to administering processes and working with the resources in your IT environment, including of Workflow Center Console (aka Process Center Console), Process Admin Console, Business Performance Admin Console, WAS administrative console, etc.\n\nProcess Portal\n\nProcess Portal is the user interface that is provided with all editions of Business Automation Workflow for participating in processes. It can be configured for a single Business Automation Workflow system or federated environments that include IBM Process Federation Server. From Process Portal, users can launch processes, dashboards, and startable services, and work on their tasks.\n\nHands-on Sample Workflow\nIBM Workflow Center includes a complete Hiring Sample process application that you can view and run in IBM Process Designer.\n\nThe instructions for recreating the sample for yourself are in the Hiring tutorial for Process Designer. See Hiring tutorial.\n\nInstructions for running the Hiring Sample process application:\nHiring Sample Overview: The Hiring Sample is included with Workflow Center. The sample introduces the features of Process Designer by showing you how to run a sample process.\nManaging access to the Hiring Sample process application (for administrators): Administrators must provide access to the Hiring Sample process application so that users can view and run the process.\nVerifying access to the Hiring Sample process application: If the Hiring Sample process application is not already available in the IBM Workflow Center Console, you must import it.\nOpening the Hiring Sample process application: To begin running the process in IBM Process Desinger.\nChanging the Hiring Sample: Using the Hiring Sample process application to learn the product. Do not use it as a starting point for your own application because changing this process application might cause errors later.\nPlaying back the Standard HR Open New Position process: Run the Standard HR Open New Position process in the Inspector view in IBM Process Designer to see the process run step by step.\n\n Recommended Badges\n\n<table border=\"1px solid #ccc\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n  \n    <th width=\"15%\" style=\"text-align:center;\";\n    Business Process Manager\n    Business Automation Workflow\n  \n  \n    Basic\n    <a href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/zz-en?pageType=badges&id=5bf38a9f-066b-4a46-bca0-67a26e5f7344\" target=\"_blank\"IBM Business Process Manager Introduction \n    \n  \n  \n    Intermediate\n    <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/zz-en?pageType=badges&id=f72abfbd-791f-4d40-89f1-db3bf6c6c490\" target=\"_blank\"IBM Business Process Manager Advanced V8.6 Developer \n    <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/zz-en?pageType=badges&id=e88a39cb-cb86-4deb-8692-0b2ba5c1eea0\" target=\"_blank\"IBM Certified Business Analyst -

Depending on the complexity of your topology and security setup, you might have to configure several different types of URLs.  BPM Endpoint configuration can fulfill this request. \n\n Prerequisites (Optional)\n\nBefore reading this chapter, it’s recommended to understand the basic configuration of a BPM deployment environment and how we modify the DE configuration using BPM utility commands.   Also, understanding the BPM topology types and how BPM interact with other products within the over IT infrastructure is also essential. \n\nComponent\n\n1.When do you need to configure & change BPM endpoint?\n\nIn a network deployment environment, you can configure a routing server (such as IBM HTTP Server, WebSphere Application Server proxy server, or other similar servers) as a proxy server for workload balancing and failover purposes. Instead of incoming HTTP requests going directly to an application server, they go to the proxy server, which then distributes the requests across multiple application servers that perform the work.\n\nYou do not have to use IBM HTTP Server for load balancing. Instead, you can use any other type of routing server; for example, WebSphere Application Server proxy server, any other web server, reverse proxy server, or network layer IP sprayer. \n\nIBM BPM and WebSphere Application Server support the following major proxy servers:\nApache Server 2.2\nIBM HTTP Server\nIBM HTTP Server for i5/OS\nLotus Domino\nMicrosoft Internet Information Services\nNGINX 1.X\nNGINX Plus Release 9\nOracle iPlanet Web Server 7\n\nWebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X Compatibility Report \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/websphere-application-server-detailed-system-requirements8.5.5 \n\nIBM BPM generates many different types of URLs for action links in the external browser client, internal communications, and connections to internal services. If your topology or security setup requires that IBM BPM must generate certain types of URLs differently, there are various ways to configure them. \n\nIt is important to identify the different entry points in your network, such as load balancers and web servers, for external and internal clients. For example, generally, the protocol, host name, and port number of the entry point server must be used in any generated links that are served to clients. Sometimes the endpoints can be defined as a static URL, but in more complex topologies it might be necessary to use a dynamic strategy, such as extracting the information from the header of the request. Below is a typical topology which requires the endpoint configuration. \n\nComplete Procedure used to Configure BPM Endpoints\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/tsecthirdpartyauthentication_endpointservice.html \n\n** Endpoint configuration should be considered and configured by the unit of deployment environment. \n\n2.Default BPM Endpoint Scenario\na. Default BPM Endpoint Scenario Keys\n\nEXTERNAL_CLIENT\nThis generic scenario key is intended for non-relative URLs to be used by clients that are outside the data center, such as web browsers, to connect to the IBM BPM server. \n\nINTERNAL_CLIENT\nThis generic scenario key is intended for non-relative URLs to be used by clients that are inside the data center, such IBM BPM calling itself. \n\nRELATIVE\nThis generic scenario key is intended for relative URLs to facilitate access to browser-based web applications through various entry points in your topology. For example, some users might access IBM BPM through a reverse proxy whereas others might connect directly to the web server.\n\n  If all external or internal clients connect directly to the IBM BPM server, there is no need to change the default value.\n  If all external or internal clients use one entry point into your network, such as a web server, you can define the EXTERNALCLIENT or INTERNALCLIENT scenario to use a static virtual host object or a static URL.\n  If you have multiple entry points for external or internal clients, for example, a load balancer and a web server, using a single virtual host setting or a static URL is not appropriate, and you must define the EXTERNALCLIENT or INTERNALCLIENT scenario to use one or more dynamic strategies.\n\n** These defaults are only used for a generated URL if the optional scenario that is specific to the URL type is not defined.\n\nb. Strategies of Endpoint Scenarios\n\nFor each endpoint configuration scenario, BPM endpoint defines a list of strategies. \nThe strategies are attempted in the order that is specified until one returns the required information. Each strategy uses a different approach to determine the transport protocol, host, and port that are used to generate URLs, for example, by extracting them from a particular header in the request. The IBM BPM endpoint can also reference an IBM BPM virtual host that contains fixed values for the transport protocol, host name, port number of the virtual host, and any URL prefix.\n\nHere’s a table which lists all strategies that are available for BPM and you could check the details. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/rcfgepstrategies.html \n\nHere I would like to show you the default strategies BPM defines for our default scenarios. \n\nc. Changing Default Scenarios\n\nBy using the command utilities setBPMVirtualHost, setBPMDefaultVirtualHost, and setBPMEndpoint. We could make changes on the default scenarios as needed. \n\nDetailed procedure for changing default scenarios. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/tcfgep.html \n\n3.Optional Scenario Keys\n\nExcept for default scenario keys, client may need to configure optional scenarios for specific types of generated URLs.  Most of time, default scenarios are used if the optional scenarios are not defined.   However, if any of the optional scenarios get set up, it takes precedence over the default scenarios. \n\nFor example, If we setup the optional scenarios AETOPS with it’s strategies and URL, when PD is trying to connected to PC or PS, it no longer uses the EXTERNALCLIENT, but the one defined at AETO_PS. \n\nHere is the list of optional scenario keys available\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/rcfgepoptscnkey.html \n\nSetting up Optional Scenarios for complex topologies\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/tcfgepcreatescn.html \n\nConfiguring endpoints for dynamic URLs \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/1074580 \n\n4.Endpoint Lookup \n\nWhen an endpoint lookup is required by a particular product feature, there is an optional and a default scenario associated with each specific lookup. When the lookup is performed, the following actions are taken in order until an endpoint URL value is returned.\nThe optional scenario is checked.\nThe default scenario is checked.\nThe default virtual host for the deployment environment is checked.\nThe CurrentJVMDefaultTransportStrategy is used.\n\nBy default, most lookups will use the CurrentJVMDefaultTransportStrategy if no changes have been made to the endpoint settings, which results in a URL pointing at the HTTPS port of the current JVM. For most cases, you can modify only the default scenarios or rely on the default behavior.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n Data Collection\n\n1.Logs & Trace\n\nFor endpoint lookup \nTrace String: =info: WLE.=all:com.ibm.bpm.endpoint.*=all\n\nFor general BPM connectivity including endpoint\n=info: WLE.=all:com.ibm.bpm.endpoint.=all:org.apache.commons.httpclient.=all\n\n2.Resetting endpoint service cache\n\nIf client need to enable the endpoint trace above, sometimes it’s necessary to reset the endpoint service cache because the resulting traces do not contain the initial computation of the URLs.\n\nPlease use the following link to reset the cache before enabling the runtime trace\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/resetting-endpoint-service-cache-ibm-business-process-manager-bpm \n\n3.Configuration Files\n\nSuggested directory: bpmroot/profiles/dmgrroot/config/\n\nData Analysis\n\nStep 1: Understand the correct topology and expected behaviors\n\nFirstly, in order to diagnose an endpoint issue appropriately, we must identify the components and structure of client’s topology. Components to consider include such things as load balancers, external web servers, reverse proxies, firewalls, internal web servers, Process Server, and Process Centers.\n\nTry to clarify the topology and expected behavior with client, we could use topology diagram to help on the complicated infrastructure.   The purpose of doing this is to come up with the expected configuration based on the behaviors they plan. \n\nFor example, client wants all of their external coming request went through a load balancer first before reaching to BPM servers.  \n\nStep 2: Check the current configuration\n\nFor simple topology, we could directly use the configuration files to locate the endpoint scenarios defined.  For complicated scenarios like dynamic strategy which requires computation of the URLs generated, the suggested endpoint trace should be applied. \n\nBoth configuration file and the endpoint tracing should illustrate client’s current configuration very clear. \n\nFor example, check client’s configuration (from cell-bpm.xml /dmgrroot/config/cells/cellname/cell-bpm.xml) as below:\nKey Objects:  ‘virtualHosts’，‘bpmurls’\n\nBased on the given configuration above, we could see that \n   Client defined a default virtual host with host name ‘bpm-web’\n   Client updated the default scenario EXTERNAL_CLIENT to use strategies WebsphereProxyHeaderStrategy, XForwardedHeaderStrategy, and HttpProtocolHostStrategy. \n   Client set the URL for scenario as https://bpm-test which makes the virtual host meaningless. \n\nThe strategies WebsphereProxyHeaderStrategy and XForwardedHeaderStrategy use the different methods to compute the URLs needed for external clients.  Also, the URL defined overwrite the host name given, but client was intended to define host name rather than URL.   Therefore, the overall config doesn’t fit for client’s requirement which is use the load balancer as the single entry point.  Therefore, we will need to correct their current configuration. \n\nStep 3: Correct the configuration \n\nBy checking the strategy list, we would recommend client to use the default strategy WCCMConfigStrategy to extract the protocol, host, and port from a defined virtual host. \n\nTherefore, client could use the command line setBPMVirtualHost to make sure it contains all of the information of the load balancer as below:\n\nAdminTask.setBPMVirtualHost(['-de', deploymentenvname, '-name', 'default_vh', '-hostname', 'example .com', '-port', '9443'])\n\nAnd then update the EXTERNAL_CLIENT scenario with the defined virtual host. \n\nAdminTask.setBPMEndpoint( [ '-de', deploymentenvname, '-scenario', scenario, '-virtualHost', 'default_vh' ] )\n\nAdminTask.setBPMEndpoint( [ '-de', deploymentenvname, '-scenario', scenario, '-strategies', WCCMConfigStrategy' ] )\n\nAlso, client used the parameter URL while they set up the endpoint earlier, and it led to the fact virtualHost setting is ignored. For each scenario, if the url attribute is specified, that URL is returned before any of the strategies are attempted.   We should remind client of this mistake as well for their future configuration.  \n\n Reference (Optional)\n\nResetting the endpoint service cache in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/resetting-endpoint-service-cache-ibm-business-process-manager-bpm\n\nclearBPMEndpointServiceCache command\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rrefclearbpmendpointservicecache.html \n\nWebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X Compatibility Report \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/websphere-application-server-detailed-system-requirements#8.5.5 \n\nBusiness Process Management Deployment Guide Using IBM Business Process Manager V8.5\nhttp://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg248175.html?Open&mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=bpm%20deployment%20guide%20redbook \n\nStrategies for identifying endpoint information\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/rcfgepstrategies.html \n\nConfiguring endpoints for dynamic URLs \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/1074580 \n","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"EAR Deployment","description":"shyuan@cn.ibm.com","owner":"@Yuan Shang","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/ApplicationManagement/EARDeployment","text":"2019-11-1\n\nOverview\n\nAfter you develop and test a service module in IBM Integration Designer and are satisfied that the module is working as designed, you can deploy it into the runtime environment.  Business Process Manager enables you to deploy and run business integration components such as BPEL business processes, human tasks, business state machines, business rules, and other components. The process of deployment is the topic of this chapter. \n\n Prerequisites (Optional)\n\nThis chapter requires our audience to get prepared on what an EAR file is and how it gets deployed to a BPM server. \n\nDeploying BPM Service Modules\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/cdplyovw.html \n\nWebSphere Application Server: Deploying Applications\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/welc6topdeploying.html \n\nComponent\n\nUnlike Snapshot deployment, EAR deployment is not a function BPM owns but borrows from WebSphere Application Server.  From the perspective of application install or deploy, BPM doesn’t change the fundamental mechanism on how it works.  Therefore, to understand how an EAR gets deployed, we will need to get back to WebSphere Application Server. \n\n1.Enterprise Application Deployment\n\nAs part of deploying an application, you install application files on a server configured to hold installable modules. \n\nYou can install the following enterprise modules on a server:\nEnterprise archive (EAR)\nEnterprise bean (EJB)\nWeb archive (WAR)\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) module (SAR)\nResource adapter (connector or RAR)\nApplication client modules\n\nEAR file is one of the enterprise application modules we are going to cover in the article. \n\nWebSphere Application Server provides a few different ways to install the modules including the administrative console, adding modules to the monitored directory, wsadmin command line, and Java programs. \n\nWays to install enterprise applications or modules\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW578.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/crunapp_install.html \n\n2.EAR File Overview\n\nAn EAR file is a critical piece in deploying a service application to a production server. It is a compressed file that contains the libraries, enterprise beans, and JAR files that the application requires for deployment.\n\nYou create a JAR file when you export your application modules from Integration Designer. Use this JAR file and any other artifact libraries or objects as input to the installation process.  The serviceDeploy command creates an EAR file from the input files that contain the component descriptions and Java code that make up the application.\n\nBPM have some default applications installed once you have your deployment environment ready. You could take a look at the EAR packages along with them as examples.   Location: /installroot/profiles/profilename/installedApps/\n\n3.Libraries and JAR files Overview\n\nModules often use artifacts that are located in libraries, which are special projects in Integration Designer used for storing shared resources. At deployment time, Integration Designer libraries are transformed into utility JAR files and packaged in the applications to be run.\n\nWhile developing a module, you might identify certain resources or components that could be used by other modules. These artifacts can be shared by using a library.\n\nLibrary\n\nA library is a special project in Integration Designer that is used for the development, version management, and organization of shared resources, such as those resources that are typically shared between modules. Only a subset of artifact types can be created and stored in a library, including:\n\nInterfaces or web services descriptors (files with a .wsdl extension)\nBusiness object XML schema definitions (files with an .xsd extension)\nBusiness object maps (files with a .map extension)\nRelationship and role definitions (files with a .rel and .rol extension)\n\nIn BPM, a JAR file also contains an application, which is the assembled version of the module with all the supporting references and interfaces to any other service components used by the module. To completely install the application, you need this JAR file, any other dependent JAR, web services archive (WAR), resource archive (RAR), staging libraries (Enterprise JavaBeans) JAR files, and any other archives. You then create an installable EAR file using the serviceDeploy command. \nThe figure below shows how an application contains components and related libraries.\n\n4.Installation Procedure\n\nAs mentioned above, you can either use the administrative console or a script to install the application. \n\nUsing Script:\n\n1.Copy the module and other files onto the production server. The modules and resources (EAR, JAR, RAR, and WAR files) needed by the application are moved to your production environment.\n\n2.Run the serviceDeploy command to create an installable EAR file. This step defines the module to the server in preparation for installing the application into production.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Locate the JAR file that contains the module to deploy.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Issue the serviceDeploy command using the JAR file from the previous step as input.\n\n3.Install the EAR file from step 2. How you install the applications depends on whether you are installing the application on a stand alone server or a server in a cell.\n\n4.Save the configuration. The module is now installed as an application.\n\n5.Start the application.\n\nServiceDeploy:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rdevservicedeploy.html \n\nUsing Administrative console: (As this is the method is provided by WebSphere Application Server, I will only put link here for reference.) \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW578.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/trunappinstalldefault.html?pos=2 \n\nTroubleshooting\n\nBased on our experience, we have two types typical issues falling into this category.   First is about clients’ own libraries or module design at Integration Designer.   Second is about the install/deploy mechanism maintained by WebSphere Application Server team. \n\n Data Collection\n\nWe have two sets of mustgather materials we usually use to collect data from clients.  \nIf the issue is related to BPM/IID capability, product design, BPEL, and SCA module, here is the list of data collection.\n\n1.Log Files + Trace\n\nTrace String\n<table border=\"1px solid #ccc\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n  \n    Description\n    Trace string\n  \n  \n    General trace string On DMgr and App cluster members\n    =info:WAS.clientinfopluslogging=all: com.ibm.bpm.=all\n  \n  \n    SCA and bindings issues On DMgr\n    SCA.=all:SCA.Bindings.=all\n  \n  \n    BPEL issues On DMgr and App cluster members\n    com.ibm.bpe.*=all\n  \n\n  \n    WAS config and sync On Dmgr\n    com.ibm.ws.management.=all:  com.ibm.websphere.management.=all\n  \n  \n    Authorization issues\n    com.ibm.ws.security.*=all\n  \n\nThe log files need to be gathered from the deployment manager profile and each node containing an app cluster member. If the needed trace is not clear just provide the log files. \n\n2.EAR or TWX export\nIf your issue is with EAR deployment, provide the EAR you are attempting to deploy. \nLet us know how the EAR was created. \nWe may also need a PI export from IID if there are issues with the EAR. \n\nIf your issue is with a snapshot deployment, provide a TWX export of the snapshot you are trying to install as well. \n\n3.Profile config directory\n\nIn certain situations, we will need config information from the profiles. This is often the case if the install is failing to find certain files/classes and with application startup issues. If this is needed provide the following directories: \n\n/config directory from the DMgr profile\n/installedApps directory from the App cluster profile\n\nCollect troubleshooting data for EAR or Advanced Snapshot deployments with the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) products\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/collect-troubleshooting-data-ear-or-advanced-snapshot-deployments-ibm-business-process-manager-bpm-products \n\nIf the issue is related to the installation process itself rather than the modules clients try to deploy, Or we could see the pretty obvious WAS strack from the trace collected at the first round based on the trace string given above like the exception of EJB modules or calls, engage WAS team on this could be another possible route.  The following items are the data we need to help client to prepare for WAS team. \n\nEAR File (Copy of the application) \nWebSphere Application Trace + WAS Collector\n\na. If possible, stop all WebSphere processes and clear the following directory: profile_root/logs\nb. Restart the Deployment Manager or Application Server process.\nc. Set the following Runtime mode trace:\n  In the administrative console, navigate to Troubleshooting  Logs and Trace  dmgr  Diagnostic Trace  Change Log Detail Levels.\n  Select the Runtime tab.\n\nNote: If you are in a Base environment, select server1 instead of the dmgr server. If the problem is the application is not expanded to the installedApps directory, then also enable the traces on the Node Agent process as well.\n  In the Change Log Detail Levels, modify the existing trace string to:\n=info:com.ibm.ws.console.app=all:com.ibm.ws.management.application.=all:com.ibm.websphere.management.application.=all\n  If the issue is coming from annotation scanning, modify the existing trace string to:\n=info:com.ibm.ws.console.app=all:com.ibm.config.eclipse.wtp=finer:com.ibm.ws.ecs=finer:com.ibm.config.annotations=finer:com.ibm.ws.management.application.=all:com.ibm.websphere.management.application.=all\n  Click Apply or OK so that the trace string is saved.\n\nd. If you are using wsadmin, enable the following tracing: \n  Modify the wsadmin.properties file located in the following directory:\nprofile_root/properties\n\nReplace the following line:\ncom.ibm.ws.scripting.traceString=com.ibm.*=all=enabled\nTo following line:\ncom.ibm.ws.scripting.traceString=com.ibm.ws.scripting.AdminAppClient.=all=enabled:com.ibm.ws.scripting.AbstractShell.=all=enabled:com.ibm.ws.management.=all=enabled:com.ibm.websphere.management.=all=enabled\nIf the issue is coming from annotation scanning, replace with following line instead:\ncom.ibm.ws.scripting.traceString=com.ibm.ws.scripting.AdminAppClient.=all=enabled:com.ibm.ws.scripting.AbstractShell.=all=enabled:com.ibm.ws.management.=all=enabled:com.ibm.websphere.management.=all=enabled:com.ibm.config.eclipse.wtp=fine=enabled:com.ibm.ws.metadata.annotations.=all=enabled:com.ibm.ws.websvcs.annotations.=all=enabled\ne. Recreate the problem.\nf.  Save a screen capture of the administrative console if an error is displayed on the console screen. \ng. Run the collector tool.\n\nMustGather: Problems during deployment of EAR/JAR/WAR files in WebSphere Application Server Traditional\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/mustgather-problems-during-deployment-earjarwar-files-websphere-application-server-traditional\n\nData Analysis\n\nTo diagnose an EAR deployment issue, it’s important to isolate the scope of problems and narrow down what possible root causes could be.  Before requesting data, some questions may help you as well. \n\nQuestion: \nWhether this issue happened to a specific application and jar file?  Or all of the applications hit this problem?  \n\nIf the problem only occurred on one specific application/Jar file, we might want to put our focus on the content of this application and it’s specific install process, \n\nIf the problem happened to ALL applications and files, the install service we provided or the environment may have issues, you probably want to ask if the client conducted any upgrade or environment changes on his/her end. \n\nTrace Stack:\n\nLike snapshot deployment you will need to understand the keyword of the installation process from the track stack to determine the time of start and ends of this deployment attempt. \nFor example,\nKeywords: thread name ‘InstallSchedu’\n[9/14/17 16:53:33:015 GMT+05:30] 00000619 InstallSchedu I ADMA5016I: Installation of BPMTestFlowNew_V1App started.\n\n[9/14/17 16:53:48:590 GMT+05:30] 00000619 InstallSchedu I ADMA5014E: The installation of application BPMTestFlowNew_V1App failed\n\n[3/20/18 4:36:14:285 GMT] 00000132 InstallSchedu I   ADMA5013I: Application BPMTestFlowNew_V1App installed successfully.\nNext, we will need to look into the error stack at ffdc to see which component it’s possibly related to. \n[8/24/16 14:59:19:183 EDT] 00000171 FfdcProvider W com.ibm.ws.ffdc.impl.FfdcProvider logIncident FFDC1003I: FFDC Incident emitted on /opt/IBM/BPM/profiles/Dmgr01/logs/ffdc/dmgrbac390c716.08.24_14.59.19.1135999813550397244176.txt com.ibm.ws.management.application.SchedulerImpl.run 328\n[8/24/16 14:59:19:197 EDT] 00000171 InstallSchedu I ADMA5014E: The installation of application BPM TestOutboundApp failed.\n\nOpen the FFDC pointed, locate this NPE thrown to see the details. \n\nKeywords: DMGRDeployedBPCApplicationResolver.getDeployedBPCApplications\n[8/24/16 14:59:19:113 EDT] FFDC Exception:java.lang.NullPointerException SourceId:com.ibm.ws.management.application.SchedulerImpl.run ProbeId:328 Reporter:java.lang.Class@43240c3e\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat com.ibm.bpe.management.application.DMGRDeployedBPCApplicationResolver.getDeployedBPCApplications(DMGRDeployedBPCApplicationResolver.java:566)\nat com.ibm.bpe.management.application.DMGRDeployedBPCApplicationResolver.isTemplateAlreadyDeployedOnTarget(DMGRDeployedBPCApplicationResolver.java:617)\nat com.ibm.bpe.management.application.DMGRDeployedBPCApplicationResolver.isProcessTemplateAlreadyDeployedOnTarget(DMGRDeployedBPCApplicationResolver.java:594)\nat com.ibm.bpe.management.application.TargetHasProcessTemplateNotAlreadyConfiguredRule.verify(TargetHasProcessTemplateNotAlreadyConfiguredRule.java:73)\nat com.ibm.bpe.management.application.AbstractDeploymentTask.runVerificationRules(AbstractDeploymentTask.java:371)\nat com.ibm.bpe.management.application.AbstractDeploymentTask.performTask(AbstractDeploymentTask.java:100)\nat com.ibm.ws.management.application.SchedulerImpl.run(SchedulerImpl.java:315)\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:796)\nWe could confirm that it’s not a WAS issue and BPM/WPS code plays an important role here. And we could try to request the PI and try to install it locally to verify our guess.  At this point, if there is no known issue can be found, you might want to seek help from BPM L3 and point out this exception to them. \n\nHere for this case, based on our experience, to install a SCA application, one of the very tricky questions is that client may try to install and uninstall or fail to install an application for many times.  It’s reasonable that they want to try multiple times if the first one didn’t work.   However, they may forget to clear the configuration workspace created by the previous attempts. \n\nTherefore, we usually search the name of application or ear at the history logs and we found\nADMR0015I: User admin created document cells/mycell01/applications/ BPM _TestOutboundApp.ear/ BPM TestOutboundApp.ear.\nIf you asked client to provide all of the historical logs, you might be able to see the failed attempt initiated earlier before this attempt. \n\nIt shows that they cannot install an SCA application with BPEL content to the Process Server even though the application is not already installed and its artifacts do not exist in the file system. A NullPointerException is thrown with getDeployedBPCApplications. \n\nPI File\n\nExcept for pure EAR deployment, a snapshot install could fail caused by the advanced component in it.   We also classify this part of issue as EAR deployment failure due to its root cause.  \n\nFor example, a snapshot install could fail if clients have associated advanced content modules with the problematic  snapshot although they do not contain any AIS services or SCA components. \n\nError Stack:\nCWLLG2164E: Install did not complete successfully because of an unexpected exception. Error:  /tmp/tmp_8509242345/import.zip7171900072405698481\n    com.ibm.bpm.pal.PALException: Failed to execute advanced transition, Error: Process app was not started.\nIn Process Center, you might see an exception that is similar to the following text:\nCWLLG2164E: Install did not complete successfully because of an unexpected exception.\ncom.ibm.bpm.fds.common.FDSException: Failed to process contribution dependency, \nat com.ibm.bpm.pal.action.BaseActionsImpl.executeAction(BaseActionsImpl.java:363)\nat com.ibm.bpm.pal.action.ProcessServerActionsImpl.snapshotDeployed(ProcessServerActionsImpl.java:59)\nat com.ibm.bpm.flm.impl.WLEInstallSnapshotHelper.performDeployment(WLEInstallSnapshotHelper.java:235)\nat com.ibm.bpm.flm.impl.WLEInstallSnapshotHelper.deploySnapshot(WLEInstallSnapshotHelper.java:157 \nOn the target Process Server deployment manager, you might see the following exception:\nCWWMH0197E: Problems were encountered while attempting to start business-level application \"WebSphere:blaname=MYPA-S1\".  It is possible that the business-level application is not running or is only partially running.  Please refer to FFDC log entries for details on any failures which were encountered. \nOn the target Process Server application cluster, you might see an error that is similar to the following text:\nCWLLG2164E: Install did not complete successfully because of an unexpected exception.

For example:\nRedundantStateChangeException: Composition Unit WebSphere:cuname=HSAV1-T1-HiringSampleAdvancedv801Library_0001.jar,cuedition=BASE already started \nDepending on the version, you might notice warning messages during the installation process that are similar to the following text when the uninstall phase occurs:\nCWSAM0001W: Package does not contain SCA artifacts.\nThis is an issue happened with quite high frequency, many clients are not cautious on their application design and don’t pay attention on these ‘empty’ modules they didn’t intend to create and lead to this issue.     For this case, we could help client to import their PI and found the empty SCA component which blocks the deployment process.  \n\nEngage WebSphere Application Server Team\n\nFor more other situations, we need to engage WAS team as the fundamental code for EAR deployment is owned by them.   Here are some general tips for the issues we should consult them for help. \n\nException is thrown from the calls to EJB deploy\nDeployment target cannot be found,  like ObjectName, nodeName, serverName…etc. \nIf client didn’t use serviceDeploy and console but other script provided by WAS as install method\n\nBesides, here is a list of common WAS issues happened during application deployment for reference.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/troubleshoot-application-deployment-issues \n\n Reference (Optional)\n\nDeploying BPM Service Modules\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/cdplyovw.html \n\nWebSphere Application Server: Deploying Applications\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/welc6topdeploying.html \n\nCollect troubleshooting data for EAR or Advanced Snapshot deployments with the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) products\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/collect-troubleshooting-data-ear-or-advanced-snapshot-deployments-ibm-business-process-manager-bpm-products \n\nMustGather: Problems during deployment of EAR/JAR/WAR files in WebSphere Application Server Traditional\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/mustgather-problems-during-deployment-earjarwar-files-websphere-application-server-traditional#\n\nCommon WAS issues happened during application deployment.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/troubleshoot-application-deployment-issues \n\nEducation Decks Shared by WASADM Team\nhttps://ibm.ent.box.com/s/zfsjxdmy9dai7o27f1rmcvs8gqi6yped/folder/47185220988 \n\n","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"Snapshot Management","description":"shyuan@cn.ibm.com","owner":"@Yuan Shang","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/ApplicationManagement/SnapshotManagement","text":"2019-11-4\n\nOverview\n\nSnapshots record the state of library items within a process application or track at a specific point in time. You can create snapshots in the Process Center console or in IBM Process Designer. Snapshot management, such as installing, exporting, and archiving, is performed in the Process Center console.\n\n Prerequisites\n\nThis topic requires the basic understanding of BPM Process Center console and Process Designer.  Before reading the troubleshooting part, it’s suggested to have a good grasp of process application lifecycle from development to deployment. \n\nComponent\n\n1.Process Center\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;\tFrom the Process Center console, users can create process applications and toolkits and grant other users access to those process applications and toolkits.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;\tUsers in IBM Process Designer create process models, services, and other assets within process applications and toolkits.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;\tThe Process Center includes two main features-a Process Center server and Performance Data Warehouse. These features allow users working in Process Designer to run their process applications and store performance data for testing and playback purposes during development efforts.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;\tFrom the Process Center console, administrators install process applications that are ready for testing or production on the Process Servers in those environments.\n\n2.Process Application, Track and Snapshot\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;\tProcess Application (Project) : Containers for the process models and supporting implementations that BPM analysts and developers create in Process Designer. You should create a process application for each business process to be automated using BPM.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;\tTrack (Branch): Optional subdivisions in a process application based on team tasks or process application versions. You can determine if additional tracks are necessary for each process application and, if so, enable them at any time. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;\tSnapshot: Record the state of the items within a process application or track at a specific point in time. From the Process Center console, you can create snapshots of your process applications. You can also deploy particular snapshots of your process applications on the process servers in development, test, staging, and production environments.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;\tToolkit: Users can create toolkits to enable Process Designer users to share library items across process applications. Process applications can share library items from one or more toolkits, and toolkits can share library items from other toolkits.  A toolkit cannot be deployed on its own. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;\tBLA: Business Level Application, any advanced content such as a module or library from Integration Designer. EARs and JARs created. \n\n3.Snapshot Deployment\n\nWhen you install a process application snapshot to a process server, the library items for that snapshot (including toolkit snapshots) are copied from the repository to the selected process server if they do not already exist on the process server. The process server can be connected or offline. Depending on your needs and whether the process server is connected or offline, you can use the Process Center console or wsadmin commands to install the snapshots.\n\nRepository Concepts:  https://ibm.box.com/s/k3xa5ftsgvbmycptjy23qgmsb7dysedv\nManaging and sharing assets in the Process Center repository\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/managingrepos_main.html \nInstalling process application snapshots to a connected Process Server\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tadminstallextendedprocessapp.html \nInstalling snapshots to an offline server\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tinstallingapps.html\n\n Troubleshooting\n\nTwo types of issues covered in this section are snapshot deployment and repository management. These two categories shared most of the data listed at data collection part, and we investigate them from different perspectives. \n\nData Collection\n\n1.Log files + Trace\n\nTrace String:\n<table border=\"1px solid ccc\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n  \n    General Trace String:\n    =info: WLE.=all: WAS.clientinfopluslogging=all: com.ibm.bpm.fds.*=all: ProcessApplicationLifecycle=all\n  \n  \n    Authorization Issues:\n    Include: com.ibm.ws.security.*=all\n  \n  \n    Connectivity Issues:\n    Include: com.ibm.bpm.endpoint.=all:org.apache.commons.httpclient.=all\n  \n  \n    Lightweight tracing:\n    WLE.wledeploy=all:WLE.wleexpimp=all\n  \n\n* *Regarding to the Advanced Content deployment issue, we will cover it under the topic of EAR deployment.\n\nNote:\n\nBefore enabling the trace, you may also need to increase the trace file size and number if the logs are rolling too fast. 20MB is a good starting point for the file size and you shouldn't increase it over 50MB. \nPlease make sure you enable the trace on both Process Center and Process Server. \n\n2.\tTWX File of the problematic snapshot\n\n3.\tConfiguration Files\n\nIf the issue is not clearly related to a specific configuration, request the entire configuration directory under DMGR profile could give us better understanding.  Directory: /dmgr_root/config/\n\nIf the issue is about PC PS connection, the following list of configuration files may help for further precise investigation. Please make sure you request them from BOTH PC and PS environments. \ninstallroot/profiles/dmgrname/config/cells/cell_name/cell-bpm.xml\ninstallroot/profiles/dmgrname/config/cells/cell_name/security.xml\ninstallroot/profiles/dmgrname/config/cells/cellname/clusters/clustername/cluster-\nbpm.xml (if you have more than one cluster, use the appTarget cluster here) \n\nIf there is any of the runtime configuration attributes is related to the issue, collect the specific configuration file and also request the runtime TWCR.xml file from the location below:\n\nManagedNodeProfileROOT\\config\\cells\\cellname\\nodes\\nodename\\servers\\servername\\process-center(server)\\config\\TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml\n\n4.Related Database Tables\n\nFor most snapshot related issues,  it is helpful to have the following 3 snapshot related tables from the BPMDB. Depending on the issue there are various other tables that can provide useful data. \n    LSW_SNAPSHOT\n    LSW_BRANCH\n    LSW_PROJECT\n\nFor Snapshot Deployment specific issues, following tables could help as well. \n    Process Center: LSWSERVER; LSWDEPLOYMENT; LSWDEPLOYMENTPACKAGE\n    Process Server: LSW_INSTALLATION\n\nFor issues of repository, there could be various Persistent Objects (PO) related, we could request specific tables based on the objects client have problem with.  For instance, if clients cannot view or update the environment variables successfully, we may want to request the table LSWENVVAR and other related tables. \n\nData Analysis\n\nThe key of data analysis is to find out where or at which point the problem is.   The detailed analysis of data may depends on the case by case, most of the repository issues could end up with either database problems (data corruption or inconsistency) or Process Center issues (access permission, front-end issue..etc.) It’s relatively hard to locate and find where the problem is for snapshot deployment issues. Therefore, we will put our focus on snapshot install at this section.\n\nBPM provides two types of snapshot installation process, one is online install, and another is offline, to Diagnose and locate the point at which clients fail their snapshot install, we will need to understand all of the steps this procedure involves. \n\n1.PC PS Online Connection Mode\n\nA must-have prerequisite for any successful online deployment is that the connections between PC and PS are established and healthy. Therefore, we need to firstly guarantee the connection was good before the install started.  \n\nChecking the connection requires us to understand the basic connection mode behind PC and PS.  It’s not PC firstly connect to PS when developers decide to install a snapshot; Process Server chooses to configure to a particular Process Center repository at the first place.  The configuration at PS side can be performed during the PS deployment environment creation, and it can be also modified after that.     All of the configuration of the target Process Center will be stored at configuration files (bpm-cluster.xml) at Process Server side.   Once the configuration steps are well conducted, Process Server starts to send periodic heartbeats to Process Center.  Each heartbeat can be recorded at server logs and trace, and the contains the data of the Process Server itself including it’s host, port, user authentication alias and installed snapshots.  These data of Process Server will be sent and is supposed to be saved at Process Center’s database table named LSW_SERVER. \n\nIf all of the steps above are perfectly achieved, once a developer want to initiate a snapshot install, the Process Center will use the information stored at LSW_SERVER, connect to the specific Process Server, and send the deployment package to Process Server as expected. \n\nAny mistakes or problem at any steps mentioned above including misconfiguration, security (SSL) issue, or connection issues could abort the connection and lead to a fail snapshot install at the very beginning. \n\nTherefore, we could determine whether it’s a connection issue by checking the logs and trace and then use the configuration files and table output of LSW_SERVER to help verify the health of the connection.\n\nFor instance, if we see the snapshot install failed while PC trying to send package to PS as the trace below, we could firstly narrow the scope of the issue to the ‘connection’ between PC and PS. \n\nKeywords: installation failed after ‘Request Message for sending installation package to server .’\n[6/2/17 10:21:37:888 GMT+05:30] 000035f2 AbstractSuppo I

service, we will need to concentrate on the log & trace on PS side as PC doesn’t play an important role at the following steps.  \n\nInstall the necessary library items and assets for the process application and referenced toolkits.\nRun the deployment service flow for each toolkit.\nRun the deployment service flow for the process application.\nMigrate data and process instances if there are running business process definition instances. \nSend tracking definitions to the Performance Data Warehouse.\nActivate scheduled undercover agents (UCAs).\nDeploy advanced content. \nOn a connected process server, send a message saying the installation is complete.\n\nBoth logs and trace enabled at PS side are quite readable and we could easily identify each phase of this procedure from the trace. \n\nPS Log   Keywords: thread ‘InstallMessag’\n\nInstall Request Received\n[3/1/18 16:45:05:545 CST] 00002469 InstallMessag I   CWLLG3578I: [BEGIN]  The process server received a request to

Like the example above, it failed while deploying the advanced content.  It’s more likely happened while the advanced Ear itself may contain any empty or incompatible content.  And we could add more advanced content trace to see the detailed stack trace and requested client to provide both TWX as well as the PI file to see if it’s possible to replicate the issue. \n\nIn summary, snapshot deployment issues could vary from snapshot design bug, environment upgrade failure, PC PS connection, advanced content issue, network, security and permission.  We are not able to cover all of the troubleshooting here.  This article introduces the basis and key to start working on a snapshot deployment issue, which is to locate the problematic step and isolate the possible root causes at the very first place. \n\n Reference\n\nCollect troubleshooting data for snapshot deployment and repository problems in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/collect-troubleshooting-data-snapshot-deployment-and-repository-problems-ibm-business-process-manager-bpm \nConfigure Process Server to connect to Process Center using command line\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tconnectto_pctr.html \nManaging and sharing assets in the Process Center repository\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/managingrepos_main.html \nInstalling process application snapshots\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tinstallingsnapshots.html\nL2 Educational materials for Lifecycle\nhttps://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/89523256455 \n","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"Instance Migration","description":"shyuan@cn.ibm.com","owner":"@Yuan Shang","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/ApplicationManagement/InstanceMigration","text":"2019-11-4\n\nOverview\n\nWhen a new snapshot of a process application is deployed, users want to migrate the running process instances from the old version of the snapshot to the new one. This kind of migration is referenced as Instance Migration.   Not only process instances, snapshot data can be migrated using similar procedure as well.  We will cover both snapshot data and process instance migration at this article. \n\n Prerequisites (Optional)\n\nThis section requires basic knowledge of snapshot deployment process and how process instances work for each snapshot of a process application.  Also, it’s suggested to understand how snapshot data including EPV, ENV, team and UCA are managed as needed at an runtime environment.\n\nComponent\n\nMigration Tasks covers the migrations of both Snapshot Data and Process Instances\n\nSnapshot data migration\n\nWhile snapshot data is migrated, various settings are migrated from the source snapshot to the destination. These actions are all performed as one transaction. The data for EPV, environment variables (ENVs), and teams is migrated depending on the following behaviors. After migration, the source snapshot is deactivated and the target snapshot is activated. If the source snapshot was the default, that property is also transferred to the target.\n\nEPV data migration\n  Runtime EPV changes are migrated from the source snapshot to the target snapshot. An entry is added for each effective date and value pair. Default values set at design time are not migrated.\n  If the  property is set to true, a runtime EPV change is applied to each EPV during deployment with an effective date of the deployment time and a value equal to the EPV's default value.\n\nEnvironment variable migration\n  Runtime environment variable and server configuration settings are migrated from the source to the target snapshot. Default values set at design time are not migrated. The changes to the environment variable or server configuration that occur during run time are migrated from the source if they have a modified date that is more recent than any change that occurred at run time in the target snapshot. A change at run time always overrides the snapshot default settings.\n\nTeam migration\n  The contents of teams from the source are merged with the teams in the target. Any users or groups listed for a team from the source snapshot are added to the team in the target. Dynamic teams cannot be migrated.\nIf the  property is set to true, teams are not migrated.\n\nProcess instance migration\n\nProcess instances with a status of active, failed, or suspended are migrated from the source to the target snapshot. Each process instance is migrated in its own transaction. Multiple threads process the instance migration work based on the value of the  setting. \nDo not use the source and target snapshot processes during migration because doing so could lead to lock contention and failures.\n\nTask migration\nTasks are migrated depending on the  and  settings. Depending on the  setting, all task, all tasks except closed ones, or no tasks are migrated. \n\n  By default, all tasks except closed ones are migrated. When the task is migrated, references to source snapshot objects are updated to target snapshot objects. If  is false, the task execution context is loaded and migrated to the target environment. If objects are missing from the source snapshot, migration failures might occur when the execution context is loaded. If task or execution context migration is skipped, migration occurs the next time the task runs. Business object definition version references are not updated in the task execution context.\n\n  If tasks are not migrated, deleting snapshots those tasks refer to is prevented. Certain deprecated task assignment methods lead to dynamic teams which cannot be migrated from the source snapshot. These tasks will block the original snapshot's deletion until they are deleted. \n\n  If a token policy file is used, you can move or delete tokens associated with an orphaned activity during the instance migration. Some token migration failures will not prevent instance migration. If this occurs, you can perform the token commands after the instance migration is completed. If all tokens for a process are deleted, the process moves to the completed state. The Process Inspector in the Process Admin Console shows orphaned tokens if any were created from instance migration.\n\nSnapshot data and process instance migration overview:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/csnapshotandinstovw.html\n\n Troubleshooting\n\nThe migration failure of process instance and snapshot data could have a few different consequences.   Unlike other problems, they should be quite straightforward and easy to identify and troubleshoot.  More importantly, we have some corresponding remedies and solutions for most of the common issues, and I want to put my focus on the preventive suggestions at this section since our Standard Runtime section will cover the detailed troubleshooting part on how we could handle the runtime issues after instance migration.  Here I would like to bring up three typical scenarios for discussions: orphan token, unexpected symptoms after instance migration, and performance tuning issue during instance migration.  \n\nData Collection\n1.\tLog Files + Trace\n\nBecause snapshot data and instance migration can be triggered during snapshot deployment AND after a new snapshot gets installed manually.  Therefore, we could suggest client to enable the trace of snapshot deployment if the migration fails as a step of snapshot install. \n\nTrace String: \n=info: WLE.=all: WAS.clientinfopluslogging=all: com.ibm.bpm.fds.*=all: ProcessApplicationLifecycle=all\nIf it’s not happening during the snapshot deployment, but an in-flight data migration after installation, client could use the simplified database trace as below.\n\nTrace String:\n=info: WLE.=all: WAS.clientinfopluslogging=all\n\n2.DB Tables\n\nFor issues with instance migration, we are more likely to give a specific DB SQL query for client to run against their Process Server database and get the result back to us.  The SQL queries depend on the trace stack we find out at the 1. \n\nFor example, we could see the similar stack at the trace we collected:\nSELECT LSWBPDINSTANCE.INSTANCENAME as bpdname, \nLSWBPDINSTANCE.BPDINSTANCEID as bpdinstanceid, LSWBPDINSTANCE.DOCUMENTSSTATE as documentsstate FROM      LSWBPDINSTANCE\nWHERE      LSWBPDINSTANCE.EXECUTIONSTATUS IN (1, 3, 6) AND LSWBPDINSTANCE.SNAPSHOTID = ? AND MOD(LSWBPDINSTANCE.BPDINSTANCEID, ?) = ?\nOr we could check the specific instance which fails to migrate from source to target snapshot at the table LSWBPDINSTANCE.\n\n3.Configuration\n\nDue to the reason that we have different configuration properties which could decide how a instance migration works, we will need to check the runtime configuration file to make sure client set them correctly.   Client usually made changes on 100Custom.xml and we will check both 100Custom.xml and TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml to verify the change. \n\nLocations: \nDmgrProfileRoot\\config\\cells\\cellname\\nodes\\nodename\\servers\\server_name\\process-server\\config\\system\\100Custom.xml\n\nManagedNodeProfileRooT\\config\\cells\\cellname\\nodes\\nodename\\servers\\servername\\process-\ncenter(server)\\config\\TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml\nHere are some properties directly related to instance migration, we will need to pay close attention on them while checking the configuration files. \n\n4.TWX file\n\nUnder some circumstances, if we are not able to get direct evidence from trace and DB export, we may have to check the differences between two installed snapshot and helped client with the issue like orphan token. \n\nData Analysis\n\n1.Orphaned Token\n\nA token is a pointer that is associated with an activity. The token becomes orphaned when it is associated with an activity which has been deleted from the process.  When instance migration causes orphaned tokens, you must decide what to do with potential orphaned tokens or risk that the process instances won't complete.\n\nSome instance migrations fail with orphaned token, but some don’t.  Another typical symptom could be the migrated instances fail to proceed to certain steps.  We could verify this issue by either using log stack or checking the orphaned token via Process Admin console- Inspector. \n\nFor instance, you might see the very similar stack as below:\nCWLLG0531E: An exception occurred during migration. Log the error and move on to next instance.\ncom.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksException: Attempt to\naccess TWObject with classId TWClass.f1e801c6-7957-40b0-8659-27bb3ab1c9b3 that is not available\nrootContext=Snapshot.c137c120-ef38-4f82-a406-ff89ac6a6755\nat \ncom.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksException.asTeamWorksException(TeamWorksException.java:136)\nOr you might see the following exceptions while trying to access a particular instance at Process Admin console. \n\"CWTBG0047E:Process 'BPD.XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX' does not exist; it might have been deleted in the meantime\"\nMost of the orphan token issue are very obvious for us to find out.  The challenge for such issue is to implement the solutions as needed. \n\nTypical Recommendations:\n\na.\tApply Migration Policy File [Before migration]\n\nThe easiest way to identify and manage orphaned tokens is to generate a migration policy file and use it to specify whether each potential orphaned token should be moved or deleted during instance migration.\n\nInstruction on generating migration policy file before instance migration:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/managingorphanswithpolicyfile.html \n\nb.\tMove Token [After migration]\n\nIf you migrate process instances without using a policy file, orphaned tokens might be created. In this case, you can use the REST API client to move these orphaned tokens. \n\nInstruction on using REST API to move token\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tmovingtokens.html \n\nc.\tDelete Token [After migration]\n\nYou could also delete tokens if necessary.  To delete orphaned token, we offer both REST API and Process Admin console- Inspector to do this. \n\nREST API – Delete Token\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tdeletingtokens.html \nProcess Inspector – Delete Token\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tdeletingtokensinpi.html \n\n2.Unexpected symptoms After instance migration\n\nMany clients saw some unexpected symptoms after snapshot install or instance migration.  Other than the issues caused by orphaned token, clients may fail to delete the old snapshots, or the EPV/ENV values were not changed as expected.   Here is a case that we would like to bring up for discussion. \nProblem Description:\n\nWe migrated instances from snapshot A to snapshot B and then tried to delete the snapshot A as it’s no longer useful.  However, snapshot A cannot be deleted.\n\nError stack while executing the command line BPMDeleteSnapshot\nWASX7015E: Exception running command: \"AdminTask.BPMDeleteSnapshot('[-containerAcronym SASR -containerSnapshotAcronyms SAS_238 -force]')\"; exception information:\n\njava.lang.Exception: java.lang.Exception: You cannot delete a snapshot that is referenced by tasks belonging to BPD instances referencing another snapshot\nIn order to delete a snapshot successfully, we have to make sure there is no running instances & BPEL instances existing.  However, there is one situation which might block the snapshot deletion for that.  As client mentioned that they just performed instance migration from snapshot A to snapshot B, it’s possible that they left the closed or even all tasks on the snapshot A.   And the migrated instances which are related to these tasks could be still running. \n\nTherefore, we will firstly check whether they migrate all tasks to the new snapshot B or not.    We could verify this by enabling the trace suggested and find out the task ID which blocks the deletion.   Or we could check the configuration client used when they did the instance migration.  \n\nWe found the following stack from their configuration file 100Custom.xml and TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml\n\nKeywords: migrate-tasks\n  \n\n5\n\nskip-closed\n\nfalse\n\n \nThe parameter  decides which tasks could be migrated.  Here are the three options for it. \n  \nChooses which tasks will be migration. The following options are availble: \n  all - Migrate all tasks\n  none - Migrate no tasks\n  skip-closed - Migrate all tasks except closed tasks\n\nSkip-closed is the default value in order to improve the performance of the entire process, and it also proved that there are closed tasks remained on snapshot A and led to this issue.   \n\nTo resolve this issue, we could either delete all of the closed tasks on snapshot A Or we could migrate the remaining closed tasks to a new snapshot then redo the snapshot deletion. \n\nDelete Tasks via Process Admin: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/bpmdbhealthtasks_delete.html \nDelete Tasks via command line BPMTasksCleanup\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rref_bpmtaskscleanup.html \n\n3.Performance Tuning \n\nWork attempted on existing instances for the process app could slow down the instance migration process or cause failures. Large instance migrations could also put a heavy workload on the database.    Therefore, another type of issues reported for instance migration is performance tuning.  Because of the large amount of data transaction, our clients may experience very suspicious performance slowdown. And the reasons behind the slowness could be various. \n\nLet’s take a look at this trace stack:\nKeywords: addGroupToInternalGroup and InstanceMigrationCore.performParticipantGroupMigration\n[2/13/16 0:46:50:945 CST] 0000008d ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread \"WebContainer : 4\" (00000130) has been active for 720,534 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 1 thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung. at\njava.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method) at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:140) at\ncom.ibm.db2.jcc.t4.z.b(z.java:199) at com.ibm.db2.jcc.t4.z.c(z.java:259) ... at com.lombardisoftware.client.delegate.InternalGroupsDelegateDefault.addGroupToInternalGroup(InternalGroupsDelegateDefault.java:409) at com.lombardisoftware.server.ejb.migration.PGMigration.migrating(PGMigration.java:87) at\ncom.lombardisoftware.server.ejb.migration.InstanceMigrationCore.performParticipantGroupMigration(InstanceMigrationCore.java:266) at\ncom.lombardisoftware.server.ejb.migration.InstanceMigrationCore.performGlobalMigration(InstanceMigrationCore.java:192) at com.lombardisoftware.server.ejb.migration.InstanceMigrationCore.migrateGlobalData(InstanceMigrationCore.java:130) \nThe stack above explains that the performance issue detected may have something to do with the participant groups.  And it’s reasonable for us to query the total number of records in related tables such as LSWPARTICIPANTGROUP.   And also, we could try to add the database trace to find out the specific SQL query.  It turned out the issue was caused by the large number of user groups, and we could recommend our client to purge the user group data.\n\nExcept for this, client may encounter performance issues like database lock contention, thread hung with timeout and so on. Here are some performance tuning best practice related to instance migration that we could always suggest client to check and test. \n\nBest Practice of Performance Tuning:\nThread pool size for instance migration. The default size of parameter  is 5. This is the number of threads that concurrently perform migration activities. \n  \n    To be noticed that all of the snapshot data (ENV, EPV and Team) migration are performed in one transaction.   To the contrary, each process instance is migrated in its own transaction. Multiple threads process the instance migration work based on the value of the setting. \n  \nMigrate completed tasks or not. The default value is set to skip completed tasks during migration. As I mentioned at the previous example, we have three options for parameter , migrate all tasks could affect the entire performance and total time in a very large extent.  \n\nDefer to updating task execution context during migration or not. \n\n  Because the execution context for a BPD instance or task is saved as a binary large object (BLOB) data type, the migration program has to load and deserialize the BLOB data, analyze, and update it, then serialize and save it back to the database. These are expensive database operations. If the volume of BPD instances and tasks that need to be migrated is large, the overall instance migration time can be significant.\n\n  Deferring to updating task execution context  means that the migration program will not load, analyze, and write back the task execution context to the database. This process can save much time for migration because task execution context is saved as a BLOB, which requires expensive operations to load from and save to a database. The task execution context will be updated when the task is loaded in the future.\n\nPurge application data before instance migration \n\n  Data purge is also a good remedy for instance migration performance issue, we mainly focus on BPD instances and tasks as these data play significant roles on database activities.   We could use both PAC console and command lines BPMTasksCleanup BPMProcessInstancePurge to perform such purging.  For more detailed information, please check our chapter for ‘Housekeeping.’ \n\n Reference (Optional)\n\nOpening a process instance migrated from an old snapshot causes the CWTBG0047E error to appear in IBM Business Process Manager\n https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/opening-process-instance-migrated-old-snapshot-causes-cwtbg0047e-error-appear-ibm-business-process-manager-bpm \nWhy are user / group lookup causing instance migration performance issue?\nhttps://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/question/0D50z000062kIuuCAE/why-are-user-group-lookup-causing-instance-migration-performance-issue?language=en_US\nInstance Migration\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/csnapshotandprocessmig.html \n","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"IBM Integration Designer","description":"Andreas.Jaensch@de.ibm.com","owner":"@Andreas Jaensch","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/BPMDevToolsandRepository/IBMIntegrationDesigner","text":"to be added","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"Desktop Process Designer/Web PD","description":"michaela.trautwein@de.ibm.com","owner":"@Michaela Trautwein-Ostner","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/BPMDevToolsandRepository/DesktopProcessDesigner","text":"to be added","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"Server Connection","description":"shyuan@cn.ibm.com","owner":"@Yuan Shang","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/BPMDevToolsandRepository/ServerConnection","text":"2019-11-1\n\nOverview – Server Connections\nIn IBM Business Process Manager, there are several types of connections. Each connection type has its own specific behavior and settings.  This chapter will cover the basic behaviors behind these connections and how we could do to handle the issues with them. The main connection types are: \nProcess Server to Process Center\nProcess Center to Process Server\nProcess Designer to Process Center (Deprecated)\nProcess Designer to online Process Server (Deprecated)\nIntegration Designer to Process Center\nIntegration Designer to the unit test environment\n\n Prerequisites (Optional)\nIt’s recommended for readers to have a basic grasp of BPM/WAS topology which contains PC, PS, PD, and IID.  Also, it would be helpful to understand the chapter ‘Endpoint Configuration’ to have better understanding of the scenarios mentioned at this article.   \n** Most of the information covered at this chapter is applied for BPM 8.6.0 and later versions to BAW 19.0.0.2. \n\nComponent\n 1.Connections Diagram\n\n2.Connections between Process Server and Process Center\n\nBehaviors\n\nSettings\n\nKey Tasks:\nUpdate the host and port name of the Process Center connection details.\nChange Process Server from an offline server to a Process Center connected server (online server), and vice-versa.\nChange the Process Center connection URL. \nModify the security role mappings for ProcessCenterUser and BPMAuthor if necessary. \nConfigure SSL communication \nEnable HTTP access temporarily (Not Recommended) \n\n** HEARTBEATDESIGNATEDDEPLOYMENTENDPOINT (Default value is INTERNALCLIENT):  Configures the URL that is used by Process Center to deploy applications to Process Server. The endpoint must resolve to the teamworks.war web module in the IBMBPMTeamworks application. \n\nProcedure:\nUsing wsadmin commands to customize the Workflow Server settings used to connect to Workflow Center \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tconnecttopctr.html  \n\nUsing the administrative console to customize the Workflow Server used to connect to Workflow Center \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tconnecttopctr2.html \n\n 3.Connections from Process Designer to Process Center (deprecated) \nBehaviors\n\nSettings\n\nComponents of desktop Process Designer use multiple endpoints in communicating with Process Center. The initial connection is defined in the Process Designer eclipse.ini file as the value of the com.ibm.bpm.processcenter.url system property. The property value is set during Process Designer configuration based on the value of the EXTERNAL endpoint for bpmrepo-services.war that is configured on the Process Center.  \n\nIf the endpoint configuration of the bpmrepo-services.war file has changed, desktop Process Designer must be downloaded from the Process Center using a browser that is running on the machine where the Process Designer will be installed. Installing an interim fix also requires Process Designer to be downloaded and installed again. Developers should never update the connection information in the Process Designer eclipse.ini file. \n\nProblems with desktop Process Designer \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/startingae.html  \n** As the HTTPS communication is used by default here, the default port for it should be WCdefaulthostsecure, please noted it is the port of cluster member (server) rather than dmgr. \n\n4.Connections from Process Designer to online Process Server (deprecated)\nBehaviors\n\nSettings\n\nDesktop Process Designer uses the Process Server settings that are stored in Process Center to initially connect to the online process servers by using HTTP connections.  \n\nThe URLs that desktop Process Designer uses in an HTTP connection are determined by the Process Server endpoint configuration, which is loaded after the initial connection. By default, desktop Process Designer uses the generic scenario EXTERNAL_CLIENT for all URLs to access Process Server \n\nIf a different endpoint scenario is required, then you can use the following group of optional scenarios, which take precedence over the EXTERNAL_CLIENT:  (At PS Side)  \nAETOPS\nPROCESS_CENTER\nAEIMAGESPREFIX\nAEPORTALPREFIX\nAEWEBAPIPREFIX\nAESERVLETPREFIX\nAEBPMRESTSERVICECR_PREFIX\nAESOCIALBUSWEBAPP_PREFIX\nAERESTGATEWAYCRPREFIX\n\n** Process Designer uses only HTTP calls because httpProtocolOnly is set to true.  \n** ProviderID is the bootstrap address for EJB calls and is should be stored at PC side given by PS heartbeat. \n\n 5.Connections between Integration Designer to Process Center \nBehavior\n\nSettings\n\nAccessing the Process Center repository \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.wid.integ.doc/processcenter/topics/topenpc.html  \n\n** The default port of ORB BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS is listening the request from IID to PC. \n\n** If the port is not accessible, the Process Center may reside behind a firewall and Integration Designer may reside outside the firewall. \n\n6.Connections between Integration Designer to the UTE\nBehavior\n\nIf you have developed modules or mediation modules in Integration Designer, you can deploy the modules to a UTE server in the Servers view for the purpose of testing using the integration test client. \nSettings\n\nIf you chose to install the Workflow Server test environment profile when you installed Integration Designer, then you will already have a default unit test environment (UTE) server that was automatically created. However, if you deleted the default server or if you are working with a standalone installation of Workflow Server, you will need to manually create a test environment server for testing your integration and mediation modules. \n\nWorking with Unit Testing Environment(UTE)\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.wid.admin.doc/deploy/topics/tworkuteserv.html \n\n Troubleshooting\nData Collection\n\n 1.Server Trace & Logs\nTrace needed for different issues are various.  Generally, we would suggest to enable the connectivity trace if there is no obvious exception can be traced.  \nConnectivity Trace String:  \n=info: WLE.=all:com.ibm.bpm.endpoint.=all:org.apache.commons.httpclient.=all \n\nSecurity Trace String:  \n=info:com.ibm.ws.security.=all:com.ibm.websphere.security.=all:com.ibm.websphere.wim.=all:com.ibm.wsspi.wim.=all:com.ibm.ws.wim.=all \n\nSSL Trace String: \n*=info:SSL=all \n\nHTTP Connection:  \n=info:com.ibm.ws.webcontainer=all: HTTPChannel=all\n\nIf IBM HTTP Server is configured and involved in the issue, please follow the instruction provided to collect IHS trace.   If you just would like to have a quick glance, collect the access.log should be sufficient.  \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ihsdiag-utility-package-capturing-ibm-http-server-diagnostic-information \n\n2.Configuration Files\nIf there are no specific properties we would like to check, we would suggest collecting the entire directory from location:  dmgr_root/config/cells/\n\nFor PC PS Connectivity issue, here is a list of configuration files you may want to pay attention. Please make sure you check them at both PC and PS sides.  \ninstallroot/profiles/dmgrname/config/cells/cellname/cell-bpm.xml installroot/profiles/dmgrname/config/cells/cellname/security.xml installroot/profiles/dmgrname/config/cells/cellname/clusters/clustername/cluster-bpm.xml   \n(if you have more than one cluster, use the appTarget cluster here) \n\nIf there is any of the runtime configuration attributes is related to the issue, collect the specific configuration file and also request the runtime TWCR.xml file from the location below: \n\nManagedNodeProfileROOT\\config\\cells\\cellname\\nodes\\nodename\\servers\\servername\\process-center(server)\\config\\TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml \n\n 3.Fiddler & Network trace\nFiddler trace collection procedure: \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-perform-fiddler-trace-capture-network-traffic-1 \n4.Trace add on Eclipse client side\nFor desktop Process Designer issue, we have specific trace could add on PD eclipse side. Please follow the instruction below to complete the steps.  \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/collect-troubleshooting-data-ibm-process-designer-problems-ibm-business-process-manager-bpm  \n\nFor Integration Designer issue, please use this link here to apply the trace. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/collect-troubleshooting-data-ibm-integration-designer  \n 5.Database Table\nIf the issue is about connection to Process Server, then the information comes from Process Server is essential.  \nProcess Center: LSW_SERVER  \nProcess Server: LSW_SYSTEM \n\nData Analysis\nFor most of the connection issues, we will need to locate the problematic component from a complicated topology or architecture, and then to do more troubleshooting on the specific component.  That requires you to understand the topology or the involved severs and modules very clearly before data analysis part.  \n\nStep 1: Understand the topology and participant nodes/servers within the network. \n\nAs the very first step of the troubleshooting of a connection issue, you could request clients to explain the participant parties within this connection issue or provide their topology diagram if it’s quite complicated to describe.  \n\nStep 2: Use logs & trace to locate the problematic component.  \nFor example, if client’s PS failed to connect to PC, and they saw the redirect code HTTP: 302 at the PS logs \nCWLLG0095W: The repository contact failed with a status of: 302 \nOR \nCWLLG0095W: Unable to connect to Process Center. The contact failed with a status of: 302 \nThis could be caused by PS, PC or the other modules between them like IHS, web server, or Firewall.  \nWe could check the IHS and web browser of PC server first, if the logs of IHS (like access_timestamp.log) shows the request sent by PS has been sent but redirected for some reason. And there is no incoming request received by PC side.  We could basically confirm that the problem is at HTTP Server side.     \nIf the request passed through IHS successfully and got received by PC and redirected, then we should focus on the Process Center side.   It’s pretty straightforward.  \n\nStep 3: Common methods of analysis  \nOnce we focus on a specific component of BPM, we will need to rely on the data we collect from clients.  \nFor example, to check the current connection configuration between PC and PS, we could check the file cluster-bpm.xml (dmgrroot/config/cells/cellname/clusters/cluster_name/cluster-bpm.xml) at Process Server and you will see the following properties.  \nKey properties: processCenterUrl and heartBeatInterval \n \nThese properties illustrated that the Process Center was configured with URL http://ibmbpm:9080/ProcessCenter for connection, and PC is supposed to receive the heartbeats sent by PS every 10 seconds.   \nYou could verify this by 1. Entering the URL specified at a browser on the machine of Process Server. 2. Check if PC actually receive the heartbeat every 10 seconds.  \n\nIn order to verify it at PC side, you could check the database table LSW_SERVER and let client to export the entire table to you.  \nYou may see the table export like this \n(Only key columns are extracted here)  \n<table border=\"1px solid ccc\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n  \n    SERVER_ID\n    NAME\n    ADDRESS\n    PROVIDER_URL\n    PORT\n    IS_OFFLINE\n    LAST_HEARTBEAT \n    USER_NAME \n  \n  \n    8ac8f93-a26d-4ead-ab85-c644bfbde68d\n    Prod_PS\n    https://bpmpsprod:9443/teamworks\n    corbaname:iiop:bpmpsprod:9810 \n    9443\n    F\n    2019-10-01-02.03.19.091000\n    bpmadmin\n  \n\nWe could tell that there is a connected Process Server named Prod_PS with address https://bpmpsprod:9443/teamworks . The latest heartbeat PC received from PS was at 10/01/2019 02:03:19.   If client reported this issue after this time stamp, for instance at 10/25/2019, it basically proved that this connection has been lost for more than 25 days. We will need to focus on the PS and all of the participant nodes/servers between PC and PS.  \n\nIf we could use the step 2 to exclude the possibilities of other participant servers like IHS and web servers, between two servers, we should think about authentication and authorization issues at this moment.  \n\nTo validate our presumptions, we will need to verify whether the username & password are mapped to the correct authentication alias and given to the expected security role.   As I mentioned at the diagram for PC PS connection, the authentication alias of the role ProcessCenterUser has to be existed at Process Center and configured at Process Server. The user name & password mapped to it have to be same at both sides.  \n\nCheck the file cell-bpm.xml and security.xml (dmgrroot/config/cells/cellname/security.xml and cell-bpm.xml) to locate the ProcessCenteruser configured at PS. We could find out the following mapping: \n<authDataEntries xmi:id=\"JAASAuthData1542562019436\" alias=\"PROCCTRUSERALIASDe\" userId=\"bpmadmin\" password=\"{xor}DhGS762Xc\" description=\"\"/ \nProcessCenterUser -- PROCCTRUSERALIAS_De – bpmadmin \nTo find the corresponding cell-bpm.xml and security.xml at PC side: \n<authDataEntries xmi:id=\"JAASAuthData_1541638326243\" alias=\"CellAdminAlias\" userId=\"bpmadmin\" password=\"{xor}DDYyMz4zPnxtb25n\" description=\"BPM Cell Administrator Alias\"/  \nWe could see that the user bpmadmin exists at Process Center side, but the encrypted password doesn’t look match with each other.   We could ask client if they modified their password recently or not to validate our findings.  \n\nReference (Optional) \n\nConnections in Business Process Manager \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/c_overviewconnections.html  \n\nUsing wsadmin commands to customize the Workflow Server settings used to connect to Workflow Center \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tconnecttopctr.html  \n\nUsing the administrative console to customize the Workflow Server used to connect to Workflow Center \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tconnecttopctr2.html  \n\nWorking with Unit Testing Environment(UTE) \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.wid.admin.doc/deploy/topics/tworkuteserv.html  \n\nConfiguring SSL Communication \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.bpmesb.doc/topics/tinscnfgsslnd.html  \n\n \n","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"High CPU","description":"jennthom@us.ibm.com","owner":"@Jennifer Thompson","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/Performance/HighCPU","text":"Date:2019-10-16\n\nOverview \nDocumentation to diagnose IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) high CPU, hang, and Performance cases. \n\n Prerequisites (Optional) \nIt is useful to have a basic understanding of Java stack traces. \n\nComponent \nBest practices for high JVM CPU utilization issues:https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/radmmemoryerrorscpu.html \n\n Troubleshooting \nData Collection\nWebSphere (WAS) Mustgather Links (varies by operating system): \n\nLinux: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/mustgather-performance-hang-or-high-cpu-issues-websphere-application-server-linux  \n\nWindows: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/mustgather-performance-hang-or-high-cpu-issues-windows  \n\nAIX: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/mustgather-performance-hang-or-high-cpu-issues-websphere-application-server-aix  \n\nSolaris: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/mustgather-performance-hang-or-high-cpu-issues-solaris \n\n Data Analysis \n\nBPM Performance-High CPU Decision Tree  \n\nThis document is a step-by-step guide to diagnose BPM high CPU, hangs, and performance issues. \nhttps://ibm.box.com/s/zbc922g4sl026q9ho9v425yfhw3hp5lq\n\nReference (Optional) \n\n1.WASSDK Reference doc: https://ibm.box.com/s/von422yyw9ugaj9j6vzl7qvempkteev6\n\n2.WASSDK Performance doc reference: https://ibm.box.com/s/iwl5lf0fwfd8dqvyrc34f218te0msv9r  \n\n \n","wordCount":0,"topics":[],"type":"Content"},{"name":"Out of Memory/High Memory","description":"jennthom@us.ibm.com","owner":"@Jennifer Thompson","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/Performance/OutofMemory","text":"Date:2019-10-16\n\nOverview \n\nDocumentation to diagnose IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and Java Virtual Machine (JVM) abends. \n\n Prerequisites (Optional) \n\nIt is useful to have a basic understanding of Java object construction and Java stack traces. \n\nComponent\n\n1.Review “OOM Review and Survival Guide” \nhttps://ibm.box.com/s/podg0ga1vbi9yy02o2q6hjfyjin4htn1   \n\n2.Review “Best practices for JVM memory issues” \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/radmmemoryerrorsgeneral.htmlB\n\n Troubleshooting \n\nData Collection \n\nMustGather: Out of Memory errors with WebSphere Application Server on AIX, Linux, or Windows \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/mustgather-out-memory-errors-websphere-application-server-aix-linux-or-windows \n\nMustGather: Out of Memory errors with WebSphere Application Server on Solaris -

These adapters are based on the Java Connector Architecture (JCA).  Adapters enable business applications to act as services by connecting them to diverse enterprise information systems (EISs), such as databases, enterprise resource planning systems, file systems, and email systems. \n\n Prerequisites\n\nThe Connector Architecture enables Java EE components to interact with enterprise information systems (EISs) and EISs to interact with Java EE components. EIS software includes various types of systems: enterprise resource planning (ERP), mainframe transaction processing, and nonrelational databases, among others. Connector architecture simplifies the integration of diverse EISs. Each EIS requires only one implementation of the Connector architecture. Because an implementation adheres to the Connector specification, it is portable across all compliant Java EE servers. \n\nThis tutorial will be useful for learning the basics of JCA. This is an elementary tutorial that introduces the concepts of WebSphere Adapter. \n\nJ2EE Connector Architecture: \nhttps://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/index-138715.html\n\nComponent\n\n EIS – Enterprise Information System\nThis term is used to describe the applications that form an enterprise's existing system for handling company-wide information. An enterprise information system offers a well-defined set of services that are exposed as local or remote interfaces or both. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Database are typical enterprise information systems. \n\nEMD – Enterprise Metadata Discovery\nA specification that you can use to examine an EIS and get details of business object data structures and APIs. An EMD stores definitions as XML schemas by default,  and builds components that can access the EIS. \n\n BO - Business Object\nIn a development or production environment, a set of XML schema attributes that represents a business entity (such as an invoice) and the definition of actions that can be performed on those attributes (such as the create and update operations). \n\nInbound\nAn event is generated on the EIS and the adapter responds to the event by sending a message to BAW. The WebSphere Adapters export support inbound communication. When the EIS sends an event to the adapter, a message is propagated from the WebSphere Adapters export.\n\n Outbound\nBAW uses the adapter to send a request to the EIS. The WebSphere Adapters import support outbound communication. When a message is propagated to the WebSphere Adapters import node, the adapter sends a request to the EIS. \n\nWebSphere Technology Adapters, which integrate using file exchange and database records, include:  \nWebSphere Adapter for Email - enables the exchange of business objects with a variety of applications \nWebSphere Adapter for Enterprise Content Management - create integrated processes that include the exchange of information with a CMIS server\nWebSphere Adapter for Flat Files - enables the communication with an application through the exchange of text files \nWebSphere Adapter for FTP - extends ESB with business document exchange via FTP server \nWebSphere Adapter for IBM i - enables bi-directional connectivity and exchange of information with IBM i applications\nWebSphere Adapter for JDBC - allows exchange of objects with applications built on any database supported by JDBC Driver  \nWebSphere Adapter for Lotus® Domino® - create modules that can exchange information with the Lotus Domino server\n\n WebSphere Application Adapters, which integrate to Enterprise Application Suites, include:  \nWebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne - provides bidirectional, real-time integration between JD Edwards Enterprise One and OneWorld Xe\nWebSphere Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite - supports real-time, bi-directional integration to all Oracle applications modules and other systems \nWebSphere Adapter for PeopleSoft Enterprise - provides bi-directional, real-time integration between PeopleSoft and other applications \nWebSphere Adapter for SAP Software - provides bi-directional, multi-threaded, real-time integration between SAP and other applications, using SAP's all interfaces capabilities \nWebSphere Adapter for Siebel Business Applications - provides comprehensive bi-directional, real-time integration between Siebel and order management, ERP, e-business, and legacy systems\n\n WebSphere Adapter Toolkit enables you to develop custom JCA adapter to meet unique business requirements. \n\nTroubleshooting\n\n Questions to ask\nIs this an inbound module or outbound module? \nDid you make any change at EIS end? \nIs your network stable? \nHow many adapters are deployed in this system? \nDid you try the latest Ifix of the adapter?\nIf you make some change at EIS end, did you rerun the EMD to regenerate the artifact? \nHow is your adapter deployed? embedded or stand alone ? \n\nData Collection\n\n1.To trace the problems that are specific to WebSphere Adapter n BPM, add and enable this trace string on the application server. Base trace: \n\n=info:com.ibm.j2ca.=all\n2.Dump event recovery table( EP_TableName ) as well. This table is used for event persistence for the inbound module. \n\n Trace Analysis\n\nAll of the following information and examples were gathered from working adapters. You can search key words and locate information in the trace files. If your trace files do not match the correct examples, then this can assist in troubleshooting. \n\nUsage 1#: Activation Specification of adapters Start \nKey words: J2CA0523I\nComment :  During BAW server starts up, the Activation Specification of adapters is activated.

Inside a mediation module there can be one mediation flow component. Mediation flows contain the high-level mediation logic. Mediation flows consist of a sequence of processing steps for\n   Routing communications between services\n   Converting between different transport protocols\n   Transforming message formats between service requestor and provider\n   Handling business events from disparate sources\n\nMediation modules are deployed to Process Server as EAR format.\n\n Prerequisites\nYou should have a basic understanding of below technology.\n\n1.Service Oriented Architecture\nService Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an approach to defining integration architectures based on the concept of a service. Applications collaborate by invoking each other services and services can be composed into larger sequences to implement business processes.\n\n2.Service Component Architecture\nService Component Architecture (SCA) was developed to simplify the integration between business applications and the development of new services. SOA is an abstract way to interpret the services and his correlations, SCA is defined as the implementation of the SOA architecture. Its standards allow the creation of services and the integration between them.\n\n3.Service Module\nService Module is the SCA unit of packaging and deployment.  Service Modules contain one or more Service Components which contain an implementation, and interfaces.\n\n4.Bindings\nBindings identify a specific type of invocation for a service consumer or provider. Bindings can be applied to mediation module imports or exports. Exports let a mediation module offer a service to consumers. Imports let a mediation module access external services (services that are outside the SCA module) in a transparent manner. For more details about Bindings, refer to below topic on BAW knowledge center.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JB4/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/help_sca/index.html\n\nComponent\n Technical Concepts\n1.Mediation Primitives\nMediation Primitives are the smallest building blocks in mediation flow. They are wired and configured inside mediation flows. They let you change the format, content, or target of service requests; log messages; do database lookups; and so forth.\n\n2.Service Message Objects\nMessages can come from a variety of sources, so the payload has to be able to carry a number of different types of messages. Mediation primitives need to be able to operate on these messages, and service message objects (SMOs) represents the common representation that is needed.\n\nTechnical Articles\n1.Getting Started with WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus\nhttp://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247212.html\n\n2.Strategies for designing error handling in web service mediations\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1108toth/1108toth.html\n\n3.List of mediation primitives\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1108toth/1108toth.html\n\n Troubleshooting\nData Collection\n\n1.To trace the problems that are specific to the Mediation Flow Component and its primitives, below trace string should be enabled on application server:\n=info:com.ibm.ws.sibx.=all:com.ibm.wsspi.sibx.=all:com.ibm.websphere.sibx.=all:com.ibm.ws.sib.processor.utils.UserTrace=all:com.ibm.wbiserver.transform.=all:com.ibm.sr.client.=all\n\n2.Enable Runtime trace dynamically:\nLogon admin console. Under Troubleshooting  Log and Trace, pick the server where you want to change the settings.\nClick Change Log Detail Levels.\nSelect the Runtime tab to dynamically set the tracing and enter the new trace string.\nClick OK to save the changes.\nReproduce the issue and note the time the symptoms occurred.\nInsure the trace covers the time period noted in step four above.\nZip up the profile's logs directory.\nSend us the zip of the logs directory noting any errors, exceptions, or symptoms.\n\n3.Customer should also export their Project Interchange (PI) file. The associated PI file can be exported from IBM Integration Designer (IID) and is very useful to the support team. The file not only describes the application configuration, but it also permits the opportunity for the support team to recreate the problem. PI files have an extension of .zip, but do not need to be unarchived to import into IID.\n\nTo create a PI file, from within IID, complete the following steps:\nSelect File  Export.\nSelect Project Interchange and select the modules which are relevant to your project.\nChoose a file name for the Project Interchange file, and fill it in, in the field at the bottom.\n\nAfter receiving the PI file, support engineer should import it into local workspace within IID:\nSelect File  Import.\nSelect Project Interchange and select the PI file.\n\n Recreating Problem\nAfter importing PI file in IID, using IID testing tools (Test Component):\n1.First insure the test BPM server is started, and the module to test is deployed.\n2.Bring up the test facility :\n\nRight click on the component to test within the Assembly Diagram\nSelect “Test Component”\n\n3.Enter test value(s) provided by the client into the corresponding field(s).\n4.Click the continue button  to start the test execution.\n\nTrace Analyzing\n1.All mediation codes are contained within \".sibx.\"\nExample Exception 1:\ncom.ibm.ws.sca.uow.UOWRolledBackException: caused by: \ncom.ibm.wsspi.sibx.mediation.flow.MediationRuntimeException: com.ibm.ws.sibx.scax.mediation.component.FlowBuildException: CWSXM1006E: Error whilst setting properties of mediation primitive MessageFilter1.

Web service component provides a way for an external system or application to call into BPM. You can use a web service binding in a SCA module to invoke existing web services and expose functionality within the module as a web service. This topic will talk about these web service related components in BPM.\n\n Prerequisites\n\nBelow tutorial will be useful for learning the basics of web services. This is an elementary tutorial that introduces the concepts of web services.\n\nWeb Services Tutorial\nhttp://www.tutorialspoint.com/webservices/\n\nComponent\n\n Outbound Processing\n\nIntegration services enable outbound integration with web services so that processes can retrieve and update data that is stored on an external system. You can use an External Service or a SOAP Connector or a Web Service Integration step to enable the access to the web service.\n\n1.External Service\nYou can create an external service by discovering a web service that is hosted on an external system, and use this external service in a service flow to invoke the web service. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/twebinvoke.html\n\n2.SOAP Connector\nSOAP connector is an embedded integration service, Call WebService via SOAP, is provided in the System Data Toolkit. This connector abstracts the complexity of the web service implementation and requires only minimal configuration. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/tsoapconncall.html\n\nBelow article including many screenshots to introduce how to the SOAP connector to call a web service.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/using-soap-connector-call-web-service-websphere-lombardi-edition\n\n3.Web Service Integration\nUse a Web Service Integration component to invoke a web service that is hosted externally. You can configure the WSDL properties, SOAP header information, authentication, signature and encryption properties for the web service integration. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\n  https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/configuringwebserviceintegration_step.html\n\nInbound Processing\n\nWeb Service component provides a way for an external system or application to call into BPM. You can create a web service component in BPM that you expose to exterior systems so that they can access functionality in an IBM BPM application. The web service component invokes an operation that calls a particular BPM service or service flow. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wle.editor.doc/topics/creatingexposed_services.html\n\n SCA Component\n\nYou can use a Web Service Binding in a SCA module to invoke existing web services and expose functionality within the module as a web service. A web service binding provides a specification for transmitting messages to and from a web service. You can use a web service import binding to call an external web service to an import. You can use a web service export binding to provide a service to external clients as a web service. Refer to below topic on knowledge center for detailed introduction.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.wid.integ.doc/access/topics/cwebbind.html\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n Questions to ask\n\nIs the web service call in question an inbound (a client sending a request to BPM) or an outbound (BPM acting as a client consuming an external web service) call?\nIs there any Web Services security involved (SSL, WS-Security, etc)?\nWas this working in any prior versions of the product (or legacy products)? If so, which version/product was in working in?\nWas it ever working on this version itself?  If so, what has changed (could be backed web service, Business Object structure, authentication requirement, etc)?\n\nVerifying Webservice\n\nAdd ?WSDL to the end of web service URL. Paste the URL into a browser window and you should see something like the following screen shot.\n\n Data Collection\n\n1.To trace the problems that are specific to External Service/Web Service/SOAP Connector/Web Service Integration in BPM, below trace string should be enabled on application server:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.Base trace:\n\n=info:WLE.=all:com.ibm.ws.webservices.=all:org.apache.=all:com.ibm.ws.websvcs.=all:com.ibm.ws.metadata.=all\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If you see IOException related to Webservice requests:\n\n=info:WLE.=all:com.ibm.ws.webservices.=all:org.apache.=all:com.ibm.ws.websvcs.=all:com.ibm.ws.metadata.=all:HTTPChannel=all:GenericBNF=all:TCPChannel=all\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If it’s performance related issue or it’s in a production environment, you can use this slighter trace setting:\n\n=info:WLE.wle_outbnd_ws=all:com.ibm.bpm.ws.jaxws.=all\n\n2.To trace the problems that are specific to Web Service Binding in BPM, below trace string should be enabled on application server:\n\n=info:SCA.=all:com.ibm.ws.webservices.=all:org.apache.=all:com.ibm.ws.websvcs.=all:com.ibm.ws.metadata.=all\n3.For Outbound web service issue, the following materials are required.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The WSDL of the actual Web Service (including any included/imported .xsd files)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. A sample response from the Web Service\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The project (see below point 5 for details)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Sample request SOAP message from BPM\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml file from profile configuration directory\n\n4.For Inbound web service issue, the following materials are required.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The SOAP request from the web service client\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The project (see below point 5 for details)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. A sample response SOAP message from BPM (if relevant to problem description)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml file from profile configuration directory\n\n5.Project file\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. For issue of External Service/Web Service/SOAP Connector/Web Service Integration, request the .twx file for the process application as well as the service name in question.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. For issue of Web Service Binding, request the Project Interchange file as well as which import or export component in the project is in question.\n\nRecreating Problem\n\n1.Download SoapUI from https://www.soapui.org/. Install the tool using the default configuration.\n\n2.For outbound calls:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Create new SOAP project and specify WSDL URL in SoapUI.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Generate SOAP mock service. This emulates the customer’s web service so we don’t need direct access to it.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. In web service component in process application, modify the host and port information in WSDL URL to match the mock service. Test scenario to invoke the web service. This is a way to see what BPM actually sends in its request (SoapUI will print out requests received, including HTTP Headers if desired).\n\n3.For inbound calls:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Create new SOAP project and specify WSDL URL in SoapUI.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Create request message to simulate the customer’s use case.\n\n4.For WSDL discover:\nObtain WSDL and all imported XSD files from customer. Specify to the local WSDL file in WSDL discover wizard.\n\n Trace Analyzing\n\n1.Key words:\nwle_outbnd_ws\nrequest =\nresponse = \n\nUsage:\nPrint out the request and response SOAP messages invoked by the outbound web service components.\n\nSample: \n[9/5/19 09:30:42:558 GMT] 00008cb0 wleoutbndws 1   request = <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&lt;cwtNotificationRequest xmlns='http://sample.uk/hbeu/e2e/sil/data/cwt'&gt;&#xD; \n&lt;dealId&gt;[Field3]&lt;/dealId&gt;&#xD; \n&lt;correlationId&gt;[Field2]&lt;/correlationId&gt;&#xD; \n&lt;router&gt;DATA_UPDATE&lt;/router&gt;&#xD; \n&lt;additionalFields&gt;&#xD; \n…\n\n[9/5/19 09:30:42:875 GMT] 00008cb0 wleoutbndws 1   response = <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?SUCCESS \n\n2.Key words:\nsetInputParameters\ngetOutputParameters\n\nUsage:\nMethods to set and get SOAP messages before and after the web service invocation.\n\nSample: \n[9/5/19 14:02:53:645 GMT] 00000793 wleoutbndws 1 com.ibm.bpm.ws.jaxws.connector.SOAPConnector setInputParameters setInputParameters(), parameterValues = [{http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}retrieveNewApp=false, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}countryCode=HAS, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}snapshotVersion=HASE.Cards.V.0.0.0.72, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}wsdlVersion=wsdl002, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}entityId=HAS, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}entityCode=HAS, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}processStepInfo=null, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}requesterInfo=TWObject[(Active: Y), (Type: 1), (TWClassID: TWClass.848854a5-b044-4fb7-86a2-ac10bad5a84b), (Property names: ID, name), (MetaData: dirty=true, shared=false, key=null, version=null, rootVersionContextID=2064.cebe74fe-ef69-4e12-8c8d-6147a5fb95ea, className=WebUserInfo)], {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}applicationId=201607846081, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}type=0]\n\n[9/5/19 14:02:54:292 GMT] 00000793 wleoutbndws 1 com.ibm.bpm.ws.jaxws.connector.SOAPConnector getOutputParameters getOutputParameters(), outputParameterValues = {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}returnCode=SUCCESS, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}workItemId=2563, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}instanceId=41498, {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}requesterInfo=TWObject[(Active: Y), (Type: 1), (TWClassID: TWClass.848854a5-b044-4fb7-86a2-ac10bad5a84b), (Property names: ID, name, groups), (MetaData: dirty=true, shared=false, key=null, version=null, rootVersionContextID=2064.cebe74fe-ef69-4e12-8c8d-6147a5fb95ea, className=WebUserInfo)], {http://www.sample.com/gltc/bpm/rcs/integration/web/services/optimization/web/version/v100}applicationData=TWObject[(Active: Y), (Type: 1), (TWClassID: TWClass.ac644f76-4913-40df-adf8-4a535e7ddded), (Property names: applicationId, workItemId, currentStatus, smg3CallForSCL, requestedLoanAmount, recommendedLoanAmount, captureDateStr, annualInterestRate, aapsUpdated, mortgageUpdated, maxLTVProject, maxLTVCampaign, avaliableExposureProject, avaliableExposureCampaign, specialIndicator, documents, requiredDocuments, customers, scoringResults, verficationTasks, groupTotalApprovedWIP, totalUnapprovedWIPAppl, textAttrs, accountInfos, cardInfos, appCIFException, appHITException, appFraudException, appExceptionSummary, customerMiscellaneousReference, remarks, uuid, entityId), (MetaData: dirty=true, shared=false, key=null, version=null, rootVersionContextID=2064.cebe74fe-ef69-4e12-8c8d-6147a5fb95ea, className=WebApplicationData)]}\n\n3.Key word:\nfound cached WSAddress\n\nUsage:\nIndicates whether WS address can be found in cache or need to read from WSDL file again, usually this is related to cache setting and performance.

UCAs also handle Message Start Events and Message Intermediate Events in a Business Process Definition (BPD) or process. \n\n Component\n\nOn Event – Triggered as a result of an explicit Invoke UCA in a service \n\nWhen a UCA is activated, it basically represents an event. That event can carry payload data with it. When an event arrives and triggers a UCA, the UCA in turn will execute an IBPM service. This is specified by the Attached Service attribute and is commonly an IBPM General Service. The way that the UCA causes the service to be called is not by invoking that service explicitly, instead, the UCA queues the request to start the service on a logical queue. It must be stressed that this is indeed a logical queue and has no relationship to JMS or SI Bus. The queuing mechanism here is used to serialize the execution of UCA originated events. When the UCA places a request on a queue, any further requests placed on that queue are not processed until the previous events have completed which means that the associated services have completed. One exception to this is the special queue called the Async Queue. If the UCA start service request is placed on this queue, further requests to start services will not wait for previous services to complete. The number and names of these queues can be changed in the IBPM Process Admin Console. \n\n Time Elapsed – Triggered on schedule from the run-time\n\nThe Time Schedule defines recurring periods of when the UCA should fire. The Time Schedule is quite flexible in its configuration. Each time the schedule is reached, the UCA fires. Within Process Center there is a Process Server used for testing. It does not make sense for a UCA to fire for each of the schedules held in the repository in the Process Center Server. As such, they simply do not. For testing, the Run now button can be used to explicitly trigger an instance of the UCA. \nWhen a UCA is scheduled, we can see it in the Process Admin Console (PAC) under Event Manager  Monitor\n\nIntermediate Message Event (IME)\n\nThe Message Intermediate Event is an Event listener that is used to listen for incoming events within a process instance that is already running.   \nBecause a Message Intermediate Event listener lives within an existing process instance, when an event occurs that event must be matched against the correct instance of the process for which the event is destined. The ability to match the event against this correct process instance is called \"correlation\". \nThe Message Intermediate Event is actually watching for the arrival of a UCA. When that UCA arrives, the event is said to have happened. This is the mapping between the logical concept of an event and the actual implementation of an event within the IBPM product. \nA Message Intermediate Event is always associated with a UCA and a UCA can carry data with it. In the IBPM PD, we can specify a variable whose value must match that of an incoming event's UCA payload in order to be considered a match. \nMessage Intermediate Event can also be used to invoke a UCA which is the logical equivalent of generating a new message. \n\n Start Message Event (SME)\n\nThe Message Start Event is a starting node that can be used to initiate an instance of a process due to the arrival of an event. When the Message Start Event element is added, the properties of that element allow users to define which UCA should be used. When the UCA fires the data from the UCA is passed as the starting data to the new instance of the Business Process that is to start. \n\nInvoke UCA\n\nWithin a Service, you may wish to invoke a UCA. Invoking a UCA can cause the creation of a new instance of a process. Remember that UCAs are usually associated with an external service or timer causing them to be invoked. Giving us the ability to initiate a UCA explicitly adds a lot more flexibility to solutions we may build. A primitive is supplied that allows us to explicitly invoke a named UCA. \nThe UCA caller primitive's implementation names the UCA that is to be called. The Data Mapping section allows us to map the variables in scope in the process to the parameters expected by the UCA. \n\n Mechanism\nFrom UCA to Message Event\n\nInvocation of the UCA defined in one snapshot and passing data to it. This creates an Event Manager task\nThe execution of the UCA task (and its optional attached service) \nThe delivery of the UCA output to a  number of eligible (correlation) message events, that subscribed to that UCA \n\n How non-durable Subscription work (IME only)\n\nDuring deployment of the process app the linkage between the UCA and the IME will be created in table LSWBPDEVENT \n   Link to UCA → LSWBPDEVENT.UCA_ID\n   non durable subscription → LSWBPDEVENT.DURABALE_SUBSCRIPTION = ‚F‘\nTo subscribe to an UCA message, the token of a process instance needs to be on a message event. Process flow is suspended until the UCA is executed and the IME is ready to consume its output message. \nThere could be multiple IMEs waiting for an UCA message at the same time:  \n→ All of those with correct correlation (explained in detail later)  would receive the message \n\nUCA Correlation:\n\n Prerequisites for UCA execution\n\nThe following conditions need to be met for an UCA to execute: \n\n1.EM active\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;→ LSWEMINSTANCE.STATUS = 1 \n2.No Blackout Period active\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;→ LSWBLACKOUTCALENDAR\n3.Snapshot containing UCA must be active and default*\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;→ LSWSNAPSHOT.ISACTIVE = T\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;→ LSWSNAPSHOT.ISDEFAULT = T\n4.UCA enabled in Process Designer \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;→ LSWUCA.ISENABLED = T\n5.UCA enabled in PAC (not relevant for event based UCA)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;→ LSW_FAVORITE.ENABLED = T \n\nTroubleshooting\n\n Questions to ask\n\nDid the UCA ever work normally?\nDid you deploy any snapshot before the issue happened? \nIs your BPM in same time zone with your BPM DB?\nIs your Event Manager still working normally?\nCan the tokens in your BPD/Process instances move forward? \nDid you recently apply any fix and strictly follow the migration instruction? \n\nVerifying the UCA \n\nLogin to the Process Admin Console (PAC)  Deployed Apps and check whether the UCA is enabled or not: (make sure the checkbox is selected) \n\nCheck Event Manager Monitor in PAC and make sure the Time Based UCA is NOT scheduled at 2099: \n\n Data Collection \n\n1.To trace the problems that are specific to Undercover Agent or Message Intermediate Event in BPM, the below trace string should be enabled on application server.

Disable this trace after collecting the requested information. \n\n=info:WLE.=all\nBelow is a lightweight trace string that has minor impact on BPM system performance, but please make clients aware that the trace string may not catch all information needed. \nWLE.wle_ucaexception=finest\n\n2.Please dump below tables from the BPM database.  All instances of Time Base UCA should be here. You also can find the next scheduled execution time. \nLSWEMTASK , LSWEMTASKKEYWORDS, LSWUCA\nBelow are the LSW_UCA columns: \n\n3.Event manager logging.\nThis function logs every operation that passes through the core BPMN (Lombardi) engine to the LSWEMTASK_HISTORY table. Complete the following steps. \n\nUse a custom XML configuration file to enable this logging. The following code is the contents of the XML file. The file must be XML compliant and have no extra spaces or line breaks. Due to web page formatting, the  value might not be on one line when it is copied over. \n   \n   \n      \n        \n         com.lombardisoftware.server.scheduler.DbTaskExecutionListener \n        \n      \n     \nPlace this file in the same directory as the 100custom.xml file and restart the IBM Business Process Manager Process Server (AppTarget JVM). For more information on the 100custom.xml file, see Configuration file overview and explanation for Lombardi Teamworks, WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE), and the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) products. \n  \nRestart the server.\n   \nCheck the TeamworksConfiguration.running.xml the  is in the file. If not, repeat steps 1-3 \n\nRun one instance or task. Check the LSW_EM_TASK_HISTORY table for new entries. \n    \nTwo (2) additional tables will be required as well. LSW_EM_TASK and LSW_EM_TASK_KEYWORDS. \n\nExport the tables into an easy to consume text format with CSV (comma separated values) or XSL (Excel spread sheet) or ODS (open document spread sheet) \n    \nAfter problem determination with IBM, remove the custom XML file, restart system to turn off logging, and truncate LSW_EM_TASK_HISTORY. This table can grow very quickly and use database disk space. \n\nAfter completing the previous steps, send the following information to IBM Technical Support using the information in the Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination document: \nProvide an exported version of the LSW_EM_TASK_HISTORY table in a .csv or .xsl format. \n\nNote: The removal of data from the LSW_EM_TASK_HISTORY table is a manual process. To stop Event Manager history logging, remove the custom XML file and restart the IBM Business Process Manager Process Server (AppTarget). \n\nProvide the name of the failing or non-functioning UCA. \n\nProvide an exported version of the LSW_EM_TASK table in the .csv format. \n    \nProvide an exported version of the application as a .twx file with details of how to find the UCA that is causing the error. If you cannot export the application, supply screen shots of the UCA settings and also provide a diagram that shows where the UCA is located. \n\nProvide a copy of the Event Manager settings from the 80EventManager.xml file and a copy of the TeamworksConfiguration.running.xml file. Both of these files are located two directories up from the following file path:\n\ninstalldir\\profiles\\profilename\\config\\cells\\cellname\\nodes\\nodename\\servers\\servername\\servertype\\config\\system\\ \n\n4.Request the .twx file for the process application as well as the service name in question.\n\nTrace Analyzing \n\nAll below information are gathered when UCA works correctly.

Shang","path":"/BusinessProcessManager/StandardRuntime/ProcessAdminConsole","text":"Date:2019-11-1\n\nOverview\nThe Process Admin Console provides configuration and management approaches for the process server in BPM environment. \n\nThe Process Admin Console provides functionality to manage BPM users, as well as the queues and caches for particular server. The console also provides tools to configure the installed applications.  \n\nTo work with the Process Admin Console: \n\nUse the Server Admin page to perform server administration tasks and view status information for process instances and applications. \nUse the Process Inspector page to view and manage process instances for process applications. \nUse the Installed Apps page to view and manage snapshots of installed process applications. \n\n Prerequisites\n\nComponent \n\n1.Server Admin\n\nWhen the Process Admin Console starts, it displays the Server Admin capabilities. You can perform server administration tasks, user and group management, process and event monitoring in this area. Use the WebSphere command-line administration tool (wsadmin) AdminConfig commands to change the access restriction or grant access to additional users to the listed menu. \n\n2.Process Inspector\n\nUse Process Inspector to view and manage process instances for process applications that are running on a specific process server. You can use Process Inspector to investigate and resolve runtime problems with process instances.  \n\nThe Process Inspector provides information about events and processes across your entire system-including information about such things as general metadata, current activities, timers, message events, orphaned tokens, and the status of tasks. In addition to viewing the detailed activity information about process instances, you can also interactively perform certain troubleshooting and maintenance tasks. For example, from the Process Inspector display, you can delete a process instance, or restart a group of failed process instances. \n\nHere are some typical activities administrator and task owners can perform on Process Inspector.  \n\nDelete Process Instances\nDeletes a completed, failed, or suspended process instance on a non-production server. The delete action is not available on production servers. After a process instance is deleted, the row is gone and can be recovered only by using a backup. There is no way to revive a deleted process instance.\n\nDelete Orphaned Tokens\nDeletes orphaned tokens from the process instance to allow processing to continue. \nOrphan tokens occur when an instance migrates from one snapshot to another and there is an activity in the old snapshot that contains a token but the activity does not exist in the new snapshot. Deleting orphaned tokens does not recover the orphaned tokens, but allows the process to resume so that the remaining process tokens can proceed. \n\nManage Process Instances\nEdit Data section, change Due Date, Resume, Retry failed steps, Suspend the active instances, and Terminate failed or suspended instances.  \n\n** All of the actions above regarding to process instances can be done by bulk processing. \n\nManage Runtime Activity Actions\nActions include ‘Disable’, ‘Start’, and ‘Enable’ to change the state. \n\nManage Tasks\nAssign tasks to a user, remove the assignment, Edit Data section, Priority, and Due Date,\n\n** Only the task owner or a member of the task owner's team can view and modify task data. By default, members of the BPM security group can act on the associated process instance.  \n\nAdministering Process with Process Inspector  \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/tadmprocinspector.html\n\n3.Installed Apps\n\nThe Installed Apps area provides capabilities to administer and configure runtime settings for application snapshots that are installed on a Process Server. \n\n Troubleshooting \n\nData Collection\n\n1.To trace the problems that are specific to user and group management issues, below trace string should be enabled on application server: \n\n=info:WLE.=all \n\n2.To trace the problems that are specific to process inspector, below trace string should be enabled on application server: \n\n=info:com.ibm.bpm.wle.query.=all:com.ibm.bpm.wle.util.=all:com.ibm.bpm.rest.=all \n\nIf the results shown on Inspector is not expected or different from what is captured from DB directly, the following database trace is also appropriate.  \n=info: WLE.=all: WAS.clientinfopluslogging=all \n\nSometimes we also need to enable Fiddler trace and Instrumentation logs to assist the troubleshooting.\n\n3.If the issue is related to user not able to see expected menus in Server Admin console, collect the following data. \n\n1)SystemOut.log file \n2)Outcome of below command: \nwsadmin -conntype NONE -lang jython -f \\util\\Security\\BPMSecurityConfig_sample.py -E  -g  \nThe console value can be found in the 'Properties' column of Table 2 in link https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/csecconfigproperties.htmlcsecconfigproperties_pac \nFor example: \nwsadmin -conntype NONE -lang jython -f C:\\IBM\\BPM\\v8.6\\util\\Security\\BPMSecurityConfig_sample.py -E ProcessCenter -g console.manage.caches \n3)For the user who cannot access certain control panels, execute below command in IE and collect the output. \nhttp://[server]:[port]/rest/bpm/wle/v1/user/[userName]?parts=all \nFor example: \nhttp://localhost:9080/rest/bpm/wle/v1/user/deadmin?parts=all \n\nData Analysis \n\n1.For troubleshooting the issue related to user not able to see expected menus in Process Admin Console, compare the outputs of commands mentioned in 3 in Data Collection section. The output of wsadmin likes below. \nC:\\IBM\\BPM\\v8.6\\binwsadmin -conntype NONE -lang jython -f C:\\IBM\\BPM\\v8.6\\util\\Security\\BPMSecurityConfig_sample.py -E ProcessCenter -g console.manage.caches \nWASX7357I: By request, this scripting client is not connected to any server process. Certain configuration and application operations will be available in local mode. \nWASX7303I: The following options are passed to the scripting environment and are available as arguments that are stored in the argv variable: \"[-E, ProcessCenter, -g, console.manage.caches]\" \n\nCurrent value for property console.manage.caches in DE ProcessCenter is: \nconstraint 0 : tw_admins \n\nAbove outcome indicates the Manage Caches menu is only visible for group tw_admins. \n\nThen check the membership definitions in the REST result. The result should contain below definition if the user wants to see the menu. \ntw_admins \n\nOtherwise, customer should change the access restriction and grant proper access to the user by using wsadmin AdminConfig command as described in below article. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS8.6.0/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/csecconfig_properties.html \n\n2.Two typical issues occurred on Process Inspector are \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.We see unexpected results at the search panel.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.Overall search behavior is very slow (performance)  \n\nWe see unexpected results at the search panel.  \n\nFor example, client searched and clicked the task data of a specific user task at Inspector.  However, nothing can be displayed, and a pop-up window showed the following exception: \nCWTBG0019E: Unexpected exception during execution. Exception \ninformation: 'For input string: \"null \n\nFirstly, we could check the server logs and ffdc to see what happened.  \n\nKeywords: createProcessInstanceCompleteDetails, updateTaskTypes, and getResponseData \nThese errors also occurred in the logs \n[7/6/14 15:45:34:769 SGT] 00000144 BaseProcessIn E    \ncom.ibm.processinspector.rest.ProcessAdminRestException \n at \ncom.ibm.processinspector.rest.BaseProcessInspectorRestAPI.getRes \nponseData(BaseProcessInspectorRestAPI.java:762) \n at \ncom.ibm.processinspector.rest.BaseProcessInspectorRestAPI.update \nTaskTypes(BaseProcessInspectorRestAPI.java:589) \n at \ncom.ibm.processinspector.rest.BaseProcessInspectorRestAPI.create \nProcessInstanceCompleteDetails(BaseProcessInspectorRestAPI.java: \n393) \n at \ncom.ibm.processinspector.rest.ProcessInstanceSearchAPIImpl.getPr \nocessInstanceCompleteDetails(ProcessInstanceSearchAPIImpl.java:1 \n388) \n at \ncom.ibm.processinspector.server.handlers.ProcessInstanceDetailsH \nandler.handleRequest(ProcessInstanceDetailsHandler.java:63) \n at \ncom.ibm.processinspector.server.BPMInspectorRestFacade.doGet(BPM \nInspectorRestFacade.java:124) \n \n\nAnd the following stack \n[7/6/14 15:46:00:205 SGT] 00000144 RestHelper    W   Invalid \nUUID string  'null' \njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException:  Invalid UUID string 'null' \n at com.lombardisoftware.core.TWUUID.invalid(TWUUID.java:131) \n at com.lombardisoftware.core.TWUUID.fromString(TWUUID.java:47) \n at \ncom.lombardisoftware.client.persistence.common.ID$UUID.(ID \n.java:198) \n at \ncom.lombardisoftware.client.persistence.common.ID.get(ID.java:24 \n1) \n at \ncom.ibm.bpm.rest.internal.impl.WLE75InternalAPIImpl.findVersioni \nngContextAndServiceById(WLE75InternalAPIImpl.java:805) \n at \ncom.ibm.bpm.rest.internal.impl.WLE75InternalAPIImpl.findServiceB \nyId(WLE75InternalAPIImpl.java:789) \n at \ncom.ibm.bpm.rest.impl.service.ServiceModelResource.getServiceMod \nel(ServiceModelResource.java:107) \n\nBased on the stack above, we need to understand why a UUID type value was given an invalid string null value, while our code is trying to get this data for display.     \n\nWe could try to check the BPD in problem and verify whether it’s expected to see this ‘invalid string value’.  \n\nBut we checked with client and understood that this was not an internal call and it’s an external activity, and they cannot provide us the information on BPD details.  Therefore, we suggested client to enable the fiddler trace as well as the REST API trace, and the following HTTP URL request could be seen in the browser's web console or fiddle logs: \nhttps://:/rest/bpm/wle/v1/process/null \n\nThis request illustrated that this issue can be either caused by the external client which sent this request OR our product code which is used to parse the incoming request.  \n\nOverall search behavior is very slow (performance)  \n\nThe performance issue of Inspector always contributes to a quite large number of cases we handled.  Many of them might be caused by the large number of existing instance/tasks data, some of them are led by the imperfect database queries designed by our product, and a few of them are related to how a specific database vendor like DB2 or Oracle handle the complicated or nested SQL clauses.  \n\nFor a complicated Inspector performance issue, we will need to check the send and response time layer by layer including the database activities, web browser, and server.  \n\nBrowser → Server → Database → Server → Browser  \n\nFor example, if a client made a customized search on Process Inspector and it took more than 30s or longer to display the results Or it might get stuck at the loading page.  \n\nDB:  \nWe could firstly suggest client to enable the database trace, and see how it took at DB side to get the response back.  \nIf the time elapsed at DB side has already occupied most of the time, then we will need to focus on the question what took DB such a long time to give the response.      \nIt’s recommended for client to query their total number records of some key tables in BPMDB, especially for LSWBPDINSTANCE, and LSW_TASK.     \nAlso, try to locate the most expensive SQL query from DB trace or client’s DBA can also provide the Oracle AWR and SYSIBMADMIN.TOPDYNSQL view as reference.  \n\nSERVER: \nThe issues happened at server side may vary, we will need to check the server log exception to determine what kind of server issue it could be.  \n\nBROWSER: \nIf the response time at DB and server sides look good for us, we will need to enable Fiddler trace or sometimes network trace to diagnose the performance issue only occurred at browser side.  \n\nBest Practice for Ultimate Process Inspector Performance  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Delete completed Process Instances
