## Troubleshooting 

**Common Problems:** 

1.How can I add a customized property for the activities in my account? 

 A custom property is one that the user can define. An admin can define this by going to Admin page -> Properties.  An account can have 10 text-based custom properties and ten numeric-based custom properties.  
The user must be an admin to access the admin console to edit custom properties. 

2.If an admin is having problems setting up custom Properties, following information will be useful to analyse the issue: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. A screenshot from the Admin -> Properties page preferably showing the property with the issue 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. A screenshot from the diagram’s activity box ‘Details’ 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Screenshots of error messages
