When viewing/reading a case, there are several fields and areas of note; across two views:

From the *Case Details* view, you can see details and data points about the case, including the contact info, case description and severity, and other case attributes.   
 
From the *Case Feed* view, you can see case updates over time, including case notes, case status-change timestamps, and so on. The Case Feed view is also where you will make the majority of the updates to the case record.
