While working with a client on a Case they may request that you include another member of their team to the notifications. You can do this by adding someone as an **Interested Party**.

### Important Notes:

The person you are adding must be listed as a Contact on the Account within Salesforce. If you are being asked to add someone who doesn't exist they will need to register first, see <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/article/IBM-Support-Community-registration?language=en_US" target="_blank">Client Registration</a>. You should ONLY add people at the request of the client. If someone other then the client is asking you to add them first get approval from the client.

  - Contact Email - this will automatically get updated/overwrite with the email linked to the Contact Record you selected above

**ATTENTION:**  Currently you can't delete a "Interested Party" after they have been added.  
Until this option is available if an incorrect contact has been added you can;

- If you have edit option update the record to point to correct contact (or if needed yourself), 
- If you do not have edit option contact your Team Lead or Manager to update
- Open a ticket with the [helpdesk](https://ibmsf.force.com/internal/s/)
