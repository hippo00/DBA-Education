There are 3 main pieces to the process for getting access to Case Viewer and then access to the specific Case(s) you want to view once you are in Case Viewer. Each one of these pieces has a section below.

* [Determining if you already have access](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/general/accessCM#determining)
* [If you do not have access, requesting and receiving access](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/general/accessCM#requesting)
* [Requesting access to a particular cases or cases](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/general/accessCM#particular)

## <a id="determining" name="determining"></a>Determining if you already have access

It is important to note that just because you have are a full Salesforce license user and can access some internal Salesforce information, that does not necessarily mean you have access to Case Viewer. To test if you already have access to Case Viewer, try to access <a href="https://ibm.biz/CaseViewer" target="_blank">IBM Case Viewer</a>. Then check whether your experience is A or B below.

* **A** - If that brings you to this URL https://extbasicdba-support06.podc.sl.edst.ibm.com/caseviewer/ with a screen that looks like this, then you already have access. Skip to Step #3

* **B** - However, if that does not bring you to the Case Viewer page, but instead displays an error message similar to one of the following, then you do NOT have access to Case Viewer and should Proceed to Step 2 to request access. Following the suggestions in the errors usually do nothing to solve the problem.

*Firefox: "The page isn't redirecting properly. Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete. This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept cookies." Followed by a "Try Again" button.*

*Chrome:  "This page isn't working. extbasicdba-support06.podc.sl.edst.ibm.com redirected you too many times. Try clearing your cookies. ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS."*
