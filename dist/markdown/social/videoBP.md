This document offers hints, tips and other best practices related to producing videos intended to be shared with our customers through our technical suppport YouTube channels. 



## Hints and tips for successful video production:

Here is a list of Knowledge, Tips, and Warnings: 

1 . **Tip:**  Keep videos short and straight to the point (3-5 min max)
- People tend to lose interest after a short period.  Studys show that 5 minutes or less is recommended. 
- Shorter videos can be linked to make longer videos or reused for other purposes (think small)


2 . **Tip:** Keep captioning in mind and keep a text version of your script (for language translation and hearing imparied)
- Put everything you want to say in speech bubbles then export to a captions file.
- How to add closed captions in YouTube: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en


3 . **Know:** Nobody likes the sound of their own voice:
- Don't like your voice?  Use a computer generated one:  http://www.fromtexttospeech.com/


4 . **Tip:**  Your voice recording and/or background music will sound much better by putting the sound files through <a href=" http://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank" >  Audacity </a>  (Noise Reduction, Equalization, Compression - in that order)



5 . **Warning:**  Before using opensource or free tools, check the <a href="- https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/Wae20f867b263_4104_a617_15981cf26055/page/Current%20Listing%20of%20G2O%20Software" target="_blank" > Green to Open webpage </a> for approved tools.

## Tips for Scripting your video:

1 . Create a storyboard or "click script".  Even if you're very familiar with the product, it is helpful to have an outline or script to follow.  Start with a 2 column empty table.  In the right column, write your script to tell the story.  In the left column, write out actions or paste screen captures that illustrate your script. This method will reduce the amount of post production editing needed. 

2 . Every video posted should have an intro, title page, exit page and copyright details. Contact your business units video producer for details. 

3 . Run your text through a text analysis tool such as Acrolinx or Grammarly to ensure that your text conforms to IBM Style guidelines.
<ul> <li>Writing and speaking style:</li> <ul> 
<li>Write/Talk to the listener.  Use "you" instead of "the user" (but not "I" or "we").</li> 
<li>Give the listener instructions. (Do this. Now do that.)  Write active sentences (subject-verb-object) instead of passive sentences: they are easier to understand and translate.</li>
<li>Use present tense (things happen), not future tense (things will happen) or subjunctive voice (things would happen).
<li>Avoid long sentences.</li>
<li>Only use capital letters in official names.  Don't capitalize every word in the slide titles.  Don't use capitalization (or all-caps) to emphasize words.</li>
<li>Remember that videos show things.  Use as few words as possible.</li>
<li>Remember that demonstration videos are not slide shows.  Make sure some sort of action is happening on the screen, either entering text or selecting a link, or highlighting a result.</li>
<li>If there is more than one way to get to something, show them all.</li></ul>

<li>IBM product and component names:</li> <ul>
<li>Do not use acronyms for IBM products or components.  Most acronyms are not approved for external use.  For example, WAS and ITM are not approved; RAD7 is trademarked by another company; and BPM is not approved to mean IBM Business Process Manager.</li>
<li>Please double-check that you are using the approved product name!  Find it in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/recordlist/Product2/Recent?language=en_US" target="_blank"> Salesforce product support page </a>. 

<li>Slides versus voice over script:</li> <ul>
<li>Slides should be written in bullets (sentence fragments), not complete sentences</li>
<li>Don't put too much on one slide</li>
<li>Each slide should have a different title. Don't use the same title for every slide (1 of 10, 2 of 10).</li>
<li>Crop screen captures to eliminate unnecessary items -- cursors, menus, and borders should be removed if they are not significant</li>
<li>Remember to keep your presentation very short (for example, 10 slides)</li>
<li>The voice over script should be written in complete sentences with punctuation, not bullets (bullets appear run-together in the closed captions).  Don't use parentheses; write exactly the words that will be in the audio recording.</li> </ul>

<li>Comply with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/zz/en/guidelines.html" target="_blank"> IBM Social Computing Guidelines </a></li><ul>
<li>For example, [IBM] logos [or other brand identities] should not be included in or on personally produced videos to be posted on YouTube unless the use has been vetted and approved through Brand and Values.</li></ul>
</ul>
