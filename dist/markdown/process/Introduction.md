These pages describe the **as-is** and **to-be** processes for **Cases**, **Chats** and **Knowledge** for the user roles **Support Agent, Support Team Leader, Support Manager, Support Mission Leader, Support Upline, AVP, L0 and Situation Management**. 

Please be aware that the description of the **as-is** processes is reflects how support delivery is intended to work on the Salesforce platform in the current moment in time, whilst the **to-be** processes describe the future vision. In the agile fashion we drive this project the as-is processes will evolve into to-be over time.
