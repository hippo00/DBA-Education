# These are suggestions on how to do effective Problem Determination.

### The Problem as it comes to you.
* Read the description and rephrase it in your own words to see whether it makes sense.
* Read supporting/additional information.
* Try to read between the lines to see whether you can fill any missing parts in the description but make sure to confirm them.
* Try to draw inferences from work done till now.
* Do not jump to conclusions, keep your mind open to possibilities till the case is closed.

 

### First attack
* If you know the cause, test and verify and then inform the client of the possible solution.
* If you do not know the cause, read about the functionality and make first contact to gather information. Please refer to first contact best practice.
* Now apply logic to make a few pairs of cause-effect scenarios to see whether any fits this issue. It is worth a try because re-creating an issue is an expensive process; though good for learning it is not recommended in every case as it can sometimes be a challenge just to confirm what the Client already claims. It is entirely a waste of time if the Client has an issue that is a well-established feature that is used by most Clients.
* If tech-notes, fixes do not suffice to proceed, gather information, and try to reproduce. There is no better way to attack a problem than hands on.


 

### Next move
* If you are unable to reproduce the problem and have not identified the cause yet, it is time to move on to see it for yourself.
* Use Webex if the Client agrees to it.
* Advise the Client to gather debugging. Logs can evidence a problem that you cannot reproduce.
* Get a virtual machine image to see the problem for yourself. It is also useful for escalation as a ready to use environment.


 

### Alternative approaches
* If everything has failed you until now, escalate to get suggestions on how to break the deadlock. In such a situation, it is not correct to send a case to Development unless this has been suggested by the escalation team. It might be that a similar fix exists and you think a debug build can bring out the missing information.
* Do a search for cases opened by this Client to see what open issues exist and they might lead you to a clue. You can also refer to closed cases for this Client as your current problem might even be a side effect of a previous problem or its solution.
* Call the Client and start a general discussion, not repeating what has been discussed, but rather discussing around the issue, recent happenings, environment, problem, the user/serverâ€™s history. Sometimes in such a discussion you get a piece of information, which has been missing all along.
* Instead of trying to solve the problem, try to give an alternative setup so that it eliminates the problematic scenario and hence pre-empts the need for solving this case.


 

### Golden Words
* Enterprise products are complex and have a wide functional area. Years of experience and all the certifications cannot ensure that you know a feature/functionality in an upcoming case. So build your analytical skills and ability to question the stated. They will never fail you.
* Use tested methodologies like 'Elimination' to reduce the problem determination sphere. Example: A 'Server not responding' problem can have three broad problem spots i.e. Server, Network, or Client.
* Help your colleagues in their cases and read cases other than yours. The more you expose your analytical abilities, the better you become.
* Write tech-notes. Being able to summarize what you resolved in a language understandable to others clears your own concepts.
