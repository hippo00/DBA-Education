# England

### Below are some general statements of Client Personas, Likes, Dislikes, and Best Practices for working with clients.
 
**Client Personas**
* Friendly and cheerful, contrary to popular belief. Will need to set the stage for this mood though.
* Most British are masters of understatement and do not use effusive language. They have a tendency to use ‘qualifiers’ such as 'perhaps', ‘possibly’ or 'it could be'.

**Likes**
* Well-structured, complete sentences.
* A clear agenda.
* Punctuality.
* An email with summary what was discussed during a phone call, and the next steps.

**Dislikes**
* Being too familiar with them, especially when one does not know them well.
* Loud talk or interruptions.

**Best Practices**
* Show active listening.
* Speak politely, unless prompted by the customer to use less formal language.
* Stick to formal writing in emails.
