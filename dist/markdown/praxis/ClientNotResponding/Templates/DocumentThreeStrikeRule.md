# Case Update: How to document client communication


To use: _Replace the (…) and the content within with what it is you asking for from the client and/or the update you are making in this case. Ensure to re-read your final version before saving this to your case update. This is listed as Internal Only, however you can copy/paste the below into a case update to the client_

### Action Taken:
* I am attempting to contact you to obtain an update on your issue (add summary of issue).(Add steps taken to thus far. If you believe the issue is resolved add how it has been resolved.
* I have (left you a voicemail OR have sent an email) in hopes of connecting with you on this issue. I would like confirmation that this issue is resolved so that I can close this case. I will (call or email) again on (date), however feel free to update the case at any time.
* IF the next action is with the client then list what it is you are waiting on from them (test a fix, log files, etc.)

### Action Plan:
* This is the (first, second, third) attempt in reaching you for an update. I will try again on (contact date).
* IF this is the second attempt state that you will try one final time to reach them. You can state “I realize that you might be working an issue that is more critical to you and your company currently. Please reach out to us when you again have time to work on this issue”. This makes it personable and tells them you still want to help but realize they might have hotter issues that they are working. Also include the date and the communication type you used for the first attempt.
* IF this is the third attempt then state that you are closing the case and that they may reopen the case should the problem not be resolved. As above, state that you realize they might have other issues occupying them and to have them get with us when they can. Also include the dates and the communication types you used for the first two attempts.

### Resolution Summary: (Add if you are closing the case)
#### Examples:

(1) I believe the recommended resolution (add what that resolution is) has resolved the client’s issue, however the client hasn’t replied to numerous inquiries and at this point I am closing the case.
 
(2) I am unclear that the provided resolution (add what that resolution is) has resolved the client’s issue. The client hasn’t replied to numerous inquiries and at this point I am closing the case.)
