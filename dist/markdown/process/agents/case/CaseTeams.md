## Introduction

* A Case Team is a group of people that work together to solve cases. For example, a case team can include support agents, support managers, and product managers.
* Members of the Case Team have access to the Case - so this can be used to gain access to the Case to Agents from a different Support Mission
* You can only add someone to the Case Team if you already have access to the Case
