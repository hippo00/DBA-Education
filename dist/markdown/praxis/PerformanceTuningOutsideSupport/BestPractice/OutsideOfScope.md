# Performance Tuning is Outside of the Scope of Support

IBM Support provides excellent support to our clients, unfortunately we cannot solve every aspect of a client’s environment. Most of support contracts that are offered are for Defect and How-To support offerings. They rarely include performance tuning.

When a case is resolved as being _outside of the scope of support_, it means that the assistance requested is not supported by the client’s Support Agreement and will require an IBM Services engagement or support from another vendor. Examples of requests outside the scope of support can include performance-tuning. 

Performance-tuning includes working with third-party hardware and software products like web servers, load balancers, firewalls, network devices, and/or anything that is NOT developed and shipped by an IBM product.

**How the client can start the engagement with IBM Services team**
When you run into a situation where the client’s initial request in a case falls outside the scope of support, or, through working the case that it is determined that the client's application or environment are the problem, you should offer the client the option of engaging the IBM Services team to assist. There are multiple types of IBM Services teams. IBM Services are available for a fee and are not included as part of the standard Support Agreement. The link below is the main page that has links to all the types of Services that are available: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services" target="_blank">IBM Services</a>

**Services Examples**
There will sometimes be a fine-line between Support and a Services engagement. Many products provide APIs that the client can use to write scripts/applications, so if a client is asking how to use an API or getting unexpected results, the Support team would answer those questions. If the client asked the support team to write the script/application, that would fall under something the Services team could provide assistance for.

Performance tuning is another common problem that could be related to the client's application or the product itself. Unless the client specifically asks for application tuning help that is not related to the product, Support should first make sure that the performance is not related to a component in the application before sending the client to the Services team for help.

Examples of activities provided by the Services teams:
* Performance Tuning an Application
* Performance Tuning an Environment
* Writing Custom Scripts
* Writing Applications
* Designing an Environment
* Migration Planning
