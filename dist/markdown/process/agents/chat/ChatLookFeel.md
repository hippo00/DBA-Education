### What you will see when the chat conversation begins

On the upper left corner you will see the chat conversation. When the chat is initiated (you accepted a chat request from customer) a first greeting will be posted automatically. 
Then usually it's customers turn to post a question.

On the main page you will find some more tabs containing additional information.

**1. Details**
Shows more information about the chat itself like chat number, owner etc. and some details about the requester.

**2. Select Case Record Type**
The case opening form is displayed to allow you to open a new case in parallel.
Currently, customer data, e.g. customer number, is not automatically pre-filled.
Also, if a chat request is opened from within a case, the case in question is not opened automatically.
You may ask for existing case number directly at the beginning of the chat instead.

**3. Product details - only visible if chat is initiated from main product page**
Lists details about the product the chat request is related to.

When customer has replied the tab will turn to yellow (there is no other notification available)

When the critical wait alert time is reached (agent does not respond within less than 2min) the tab turns to red:
