The Cognitive Support Platform Release Schedule is Changing in 2019


The Business Units have shared with us, "We need the Cognitive Support Platform (CSP) to be improved quickly yet we can not keep pace with the rate of change." With the various transformational initiatives happening simultaneously, we recognize that delivering major changes in a two-week sprint model has its challenges. 


Going forward, the CSP team will be assessing the change impact of features and functions to provide more time for testing, communication, training and preparedness for those items with significant impact. The team will maintain its two week sprint cycle, and deploy smaller bug fixes, RFEs and functionality in between larger deployments. This plan should reduce the rate of changes with major impact, while continuing to deliver minor fixes on a regular basis. This way, the team continues to deliver value internally and externally for IBM. 


Providing more time for testing and user feedback allows opportunities for you to help us improve functionality prior to production. There are two key ways you can contribute:
As a Sponsored user - If you have the time to dedicate (1-2 hours per week) as a member of our sponsor user group, please contact your <a href="https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/385f62b0-d1a0-44bb-8918-0c71a482cab7/page/82b78df9-e7e3-450e-9d67-2bc4250001d6" target="_blank">Integration Lead.</a>  As a sponsor user, you will get early visibility into new features and an opportunity to influence direction. To be a sponsored user, we want you to participate in weekly design meetings, representing all of IBM and specifically your Business Unit, soliciting feedback from your Business Unit before making your design suggestions.
Testing - We need individuals to participate in testing new features in staging prior to a production. Contact your <a href="https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/385f62b0-d1a0-44bb-8918-0c71a482cab7/page/82b78df9-e7e3-450e-9d67-2bc4250001d6" target="_blank">Integration Lead</a> if you are interested in joining our test efforts.
