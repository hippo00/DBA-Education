## Overview 

When you are dealing with expired Blueworks Live accounts, you have two primary types of accounts: IBM internal and Client paid accounts. 
The for each account tis different 
IBM Internal: These accounts customarily have a 3 month term at which point they will expire and need Support intervention. 
Client Paid: These accounts have expiration dates that are determined by the client and Sales when the client purchases their contract. 

## Component 

**IBM Internal Accounts**

When an IBM internal account expires, Blueworks sends an email to the responsible admin informing them of the upcoming expiration date. This email is sent two weeks and one week in advance of the expiration date. The email has a link in it. The IBM Admin must click the link to extend their account another 3 months. 

If they miss the email, the admin will not know their account is expiring until it does and they find they can no longer log in; at which point they will open a case for Support. 

As Support, you must find their account on the suadmin and then extend their date by 90 days as well as check to make sure the account is not suspended. If it is suspended then you must reactivate it. 

Once you have reactivated their account you can now **close** this case. 

**Client Paid Accounts**

All provisioning (licenses and dates) for client paid accounts is handled by the IBM Project Office.  

You must: 

1.Copy the correct Project Office email to your response. Rasch geo area for IBM has its own project office. These emails are listed on the Support Wiki at https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W415e0ec58a85_4b75_b9d4_f172a6e1e57d/page/Billing%20Issues%20and%20Billing%20Team%20Contacts . 

2.You must explain to the client that the IBM Project office is the IBM group responsible for client renewals. 

3.You must ask the Project Office to reach out to the client and assist them with their renewal 

4.You must maintain the case until the Project Office has verified  they have processed the renewal at which point you must **cancel** the case. 

**Trial Accounts**

When it comes to trial accounts, Support has full authority whether they are IBM internal or Client paid. You do not need to contact the IBM Project office for any issues regarding trial accounts.
