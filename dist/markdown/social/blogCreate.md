### How to embed a Box@IBM file in your Blog
This feature will explain how to create a window for embedding presentations, PDFs and other files hosted in Box that you wish to present to the reader without them having to download the file itself.

* How to locate the HTML required on Box
* How to use this HTML code in the 'Technical Blog Post' to display an embedded Box window.

<div style="width: 965px">

    style="padding-bottom:56.25%; position:relative; display:block; width: 100%" 
  >
    <iframe
      id="UstreamIframe"
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      src="https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/120552954?html5ui"
      frameborder="0"

### Important information if you are using "People with this link" sharing option
On March 12th 2019 IBM updated Box@IBM's default shared link policy.  All new shared links with access set to "People with the link" will default to a 14-day expiration.  "People with this link" allows public access to the content without restriction. This policy update improves overall security for IBM data and client data stored in Box.  If your business requirement requires an expiration period longer than 14 days, then you can manually extend the expiration date in the shared link settings.
