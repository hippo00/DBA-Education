### Announcement: ALL service and support (remote, field, patches, etc.) for IBM products to Huawei is to stop immediately until further notice

**Posted May 22, 2019**

We have closed all the cases and flagged all the accounts related to Huawei due to the recent action by US Government.

If Support Agents receive questions or requests from external customers, please respond as follows:
 
"In response to the May 16 action by the US Government to add Huawei and affiliates to the Department of Commerce Entity List, and based on our understanding of the nature of the requested service, IBM is not allowed to provide the requested service at this time."

If there are questions, agents should work with their Integration leads.  If there are changes in this situation, you will be alerted via the <a href="https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C902QFMPG" target="_blank">#csp-announcements</a> Slack channel and this announcement will be updated.

Below is a screenshot of what Support Agents would see if they access a case related to Huawei or any account in the same situation.
Notice the Alerts field on left and the Special Handling field on the right, highlighted in red rectangles.
