* A customer response milestone needs to be completed to stop the session timer from escalation prior to 2 hours.  NOTE:  the milestone clock begins ticking down when the case is opened.  The session timer records time when a case is in "focus" on your screen.  You can have 10 cases open but the clock only runs on the one in focus.
