## IBM Cloud Technical Support Channel Overview:
| Social Platform      | Description    |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Twitter	|	The primary function of our Technical Support Twitter accounts is to broadcast focused technical support content and product updates to our clients in a timely manner.  As a secondary function, they can be used to share current news and announcements such as conference schedules and news or other major events that might interest our support customer base. Not all business units have Twitter accounts so check the listing in our <a href="http://localhost:18080/#/DBA-Education/social/socialchannels/twitter" target="_blank" > Twitter Channels </a> page to determine if your group uses this channel.  |
| Facebook	|	Our support Facebook accounts function is a similar way as Twitter. There are some subtle differences between the two channels that, at times makes one better suited for certain types of posts.  Again, check the <a href="http://localhost:18080/#/DBA-Education/social/socialchannels/facebook" target="_blank" > Facebook Channels </a> page to determine if your business unit utilizes this channel or consult your units <a href="http://localhost:18080/#/DBA-Education/social/generalInfo/contacts" target="_blank"> Social Support Program Manager. </a> |
| YouTube 	|   Support YouTube channels function as another source of support content which allows our technical support engineers (TSE's) to create visual technical content on product specific playlists. These playlists encompass a wide variety of technical topics our support clients need to either resolve product issues or obtain a deeper understanding of how their product works. Consult the <a href="http://localhost:18080/#/DBA-Education/social/socialchannels/youtubeChannels" target="_blank" > YouTube Channels </a> for names and contact information. |
| Blogs    | As part of the Support Transformation our approach to blogging is taking a new direction. In the past, we used our support blog channels to publish new technical content as well as promote existing content.  The articles that populate the existing blogs typically do not fall in line with the true definition of a blog.  The new blog channels will only host content that meets the definition of what a blog should be, which can be found in the <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/SupportBlogWritingGuide" target="_blank"> Content type definitions for a blog document <a/>. |
|Forums    | Support forums are one of the pillars of Client Self Assist.  Our support TSE's participate in forums to answer questions that might otherwise become Salesforce cases(PMRs).  The sharing of information in this format is critical to the Client Self Assist initiative.  Forums discussions are intended to host unique support discussions but also work with existing support content repositories such as blogs, Knowledge Center and technotes as well. |
|LinkedIn    |  <a href="http://localhost:18080/#/DBA-Education/social/socialchannels/otherChannels" target="_blank"> LinkedIn channels <a/>. |
