* RFE process utilizes e-mail as primary notification vehicle per Idea Zone (Zones separate Idea topics. There are currently three zones but more may be added  as needed)

* Salesforce CHATTER is leveraged as platform for Notifications(Configure Chatter email settings (control overall experience))
 Create Public Groups in Chatter for each Ideas zone (Allow users to SELF REGISTER to group,Configure email frequency per Group)
