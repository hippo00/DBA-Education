## Troubleshooting 

**Common Problems with references:** 

1.If the request is on Billing/ Invoices regarding an existing account, contact the correct Billing team. 
[The Billing contacts are found in this Wiki](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W415e0ec58a85_4b75_b9d4_f172a6e1e57d/page/Billing%20Issues%20and%20Billing%20Team%20Contacts). 

2.If it is regarding an expired customer account, follow the internal process of [“Handling External Account Expirations”](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W415e0ec58a85_4b75_b9d4_f172a6e1e57d/page/Process%20for%20Handling%20External%20Account%20Expirations)
