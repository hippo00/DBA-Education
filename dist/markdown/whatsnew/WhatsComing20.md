## Agent Console Updates
Mission Team Routing & Assignment ("formerly called Routing & Assignment OC2")  is currently in staging and targeted for production in Sprint 20.  
* A high level view of how this will work can be found in the DBA-Education.
* Craig Wolpert will also cover <a id="mission" name="mission"></a> Mission Team Routing & Assignment on the October 4 Transformation Thursday call. We hope that all Support Mission Leaders and Managers can attend - this is a great opportunity to get your questions answered.

### <a href="https://funnel.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/#/open/4227" target="_blank">#4227</a> - Changes to Escalated checkbox, and the additions of the Milestone Warning and Milestone Missed checkboxes 
* This is targeted for Sprint 21.
* Please note the Escalation Flag will be removed when a case is closed. 
* That logic is part of the Salesforce platform and we are not able to modify the logic.  For this reason, we added the new milestone fields which are not cleared when the case is closed.
* Details on these fields and associated logic have been added to the DBA-Education. 


### <a href="https://funnel.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/#/open/5136" target="_blank">#5136</a> - Create Task process for "Next Contact Date" field on case
* This is the date on which the Agent intends to contact the client (aka FUP - Follow Up date) 
* The  documentation has been updated on the Salesforce DBA-Education:

### <a href="https://funnel.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/#/open/4956" target="_blank">#4956</a> - New features in the upcoming <a id="caseprioritization" name="caseprioritzation"></a> Case Prioritization version 3 update   
* This is now targeted for Sprint 20.  
* Improved performance in the Kanban view - Cases are now lazy loaded incrementally into the Kanban view.
* User defined custom views can now be configured and saved. Configuration options include filtering on all Case fields and defining multiple columns in the Kanban view.
* Custom views can also be shared with other users from within the Case Prioritization interface.
* Additional information included in the Kanban view includes System Down indicators and the date of the last update.

### <a href="https://github.ibm.com/Watson-in-Support/PM-rumor-mill/issues/282" target="_blank">#282</a> - Blueworks Live automation to integrate product specific customer account information into Salesforce cases 
* A new automation has been created for Blueworks Live Support Team that will help provide customer account information from their backend Blueworks Live Super User Administration Tool and show it for every Blueworks Live Salesforce case that gets created.
* The automation will trigger for both Salesforce web cases and cases created via email-to-case.
* The Support Agents use this customer account information to help triage customer issues like account expirations or license renewal, so this automation will improve their time to resolution (TTR) by preventing them from having to switch context from the Salesforce Service Console to their backend Tool.
* Everything a Support Agent needs to perform the initial analysis will be right there in the Salesforce case.

### ARM Updates
