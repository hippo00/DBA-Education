Live Agent is a comprehensive chat solution that makes it easy for IBM support organization’s agents and support supervisors to assist customers. Customers can start
chats with agents via the IBM Support Community. Our goal is to deploy a consistent Live Agent Configuration across all Support Missions. Once we have delivered
consistency we will continue to enable more Live Agent Features to improve the agent and customer experience if possible. 

### Live Agent Settings

Under the new settings, the "Chat with Agent" button will also be located on the case detail page in the Client Support Community. It will work as the product page chat
button works. For the first pass, the chat button will route to the support mission associated with the product selected in the case. 

## What does it look like for the customer ?

* Clients will login to the Support Community as usual and navigate to their cases:

* Customers will need to click into specific cases:

* The chat button will be located in the top right screen of the case detail page:

* Once customers click on the “Chat with Agent” button they will be shown this screen. While on this screen the chat will route to an agent in the support mission.

* The queue will operate the same way the product page chat button currently works. The queue size is 2 per agent. If one agent is online then they can be actively chatting with a client and another client will be waiting in the queue. A third client would not be able to chat or wait in the queue. If two agents are online then they can both be actively engaged in a chat and two additional clients can wait in the queue (total of 4.) The queue will be directly related to the product chat button queues. If an agent receives a chat from the product chat button then it will count against the same queue capacity as the case detail button capacity. The product chat button and the case detail chat button will be using the same queue, meaning the agents who work each will be the same. 

* Agents being available and not available will work the same way that it currently does. In order to be available for “Case Detail” chats, the agent will need to be “Available – Live Chat” in the Omni channel widget. This will also make the agent available for the Product Page chat button.

* If the queue is full or no agents are available, clients will see the following message when they click the button and the button is greyed out. This is the same as the product page chat button.
