* If a chat is initiated from within a case, declining this chat request will cancel the chat for customer. It won't be routed to a different agent. Instead customer will receive a message that no agent is available.
As this is not very satisfying for customers please consider to accept those chats. For more details on how to identify a chat initiated from within a case please see <a href="/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/chat/agents/accept">Accept and Take a Chat</a>.
