#### You can manage the list users who have access to Blueworks Live and configure the types of tasks they can perform.

* [Adding users](https://ibm.blueworkslive.com/scr/docs/bwl/topics/addingusers.html)
To add users, you invite them.

* [User groups](https://ibm.blueworkslive.com/scr/docs/bwl/topics/cusergroups.html)
To manage permissions for sets of users across an account, you can define user groups for the account and then add them to spaces. In this way, the individuals in a user group become participants of a space and can be assigned specific sets of privileges within that space. User groups can be either predefined or custom.

* [Setting and changing permissions](https://ibm.blueworkslive.com/scr/docs/bwl/topics/settingandchangingpermissions.html#settingandchangingpermissions)
You set and change permissions at the account level, the space level and, to a lesser degree, the artifact level. You can assign permissions by license type, user group, and at the individual user level. Default permissions are propagated for each space based on the user type (license type) and account-level customizations.
