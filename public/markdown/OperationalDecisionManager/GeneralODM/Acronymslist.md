## Overview 

This is a list of common acronyms used with IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM). 
This list is relevant to all the other topics for ODM. 
Some acronyms are very specific to the product itself, while others are more generic ones. 

#### Acronyms specific to this product: 

**ODM: Operational Decision Manager**
The name of the product 

**DC: Decision Center**
Decision Center is a set of tools to allow business users to author, model, and manage decisions that are directly based on organizational knowledge and best practices, with limited or no dependence on the IT department. Decision Center includes the Business console, the Enterprise console, and a rule repository.

**DS: Decision Server**
Decision Server provides development and runtime components for any ODM applications. It comprises the Rule Designer and the Rule Execution Server

**RD: Rule Designer** 
Rule Designer is an Eclipse-based development environment in which you design, author, test, and deploy decision services.  
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.tutorials/tut_designer_topics/tut_rule_designer_tutorials.html 

**RES: Rule Execution Server** 
Rule Execution Server provides the runtime environment for running and monitoring decision services. 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.tutorials/tut_res_topics/tut_res_tutorials.html 

**XU: Execution Unit** 
The execution unit (XU) is a resource adapter for Java™ EE Connector Architecture (JCA) 1.5 that handles the low-level aspects of ruleset execution and collaborates with the server to manage resources. 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/con_res_exec_xu.html 

**BOM: Business Object Model**
The BOM is used to make business rule editing user-friendly by providing tools to set up a natural language vocabulary.  https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.designer.author/config_auth_topics/tpc_rd_bom.html 

**XOM: Execution Object Model** 
The execution object model (XOM) is the model against which you run rules. It references the application objects and data, and is the base implementation of the business object model (BOM). Rule projects reference the XOM.  
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.designer.author/designing_bom_topics/con_bom_overview.html 

**IRL: ILOG Rule Language**  
Contains a set of keywords and syntax to structure each part of a rule 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.ref.designer/lang_irl_ref_topics/tpc_irl_intro.html 

**BAL: Business Action Language** 
You can use Business Action Language (BAL) to define your own business rule language. Rule Designer provides these components in a plug-in.  
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.ref.designer/lang_arl_ref_topics/tpc_arl_intro.html 

**ARL: Advanced Rule Language** 
For each Business Action Language (BAL) expression that you create for BOM-to-XOM mapping in the decision engine, you can review its equivalent Advanced Rule Language (ARL) expression. ARL is a read-only rule language that is similar in syntax to Java 7.  
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.ref.designer/lang_arl_ref_topics/tpc_arl_intro.html 

**DT: Decision table** 
A decisions artifact that allows you to display your rules as a table, with conditions and actions columns. Each row of the table becomes a rule. 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dcenter.bu.bconsole/dtables/con_bc_dtables_overview.html 

**AR: Action Rule**
A business rule that can be edited in the rule editor 

**BRLDF: Business Rule Language Definition Framework** 
A framework for defining custom business rule languages, using XML schemas and property files. 

**BRMS: Business Rule Management System**
A system designed to modify and manage business logic independently from the applications within an organization. 

**DS: Decision Service**
A decision service contains one or more rule projects. Each rule project contains action rules and decision tables that you update directly. You can easily move among the projects to make changes, and deploy the decision service to a test or production environment. 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dcenter.bu.bconsole/mng_changes/con_bc_ds_decisionservices.html 

**DGF: Decision Governance Framework** 
The decision governance framework is a methodology that provides you with tools to implement changes to your business rules in a structured, secure, and controlled way. 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.dcenter.bu.bconsole/mng_changes/con_bc_governance.html 

**DVS: Decision Validation Service** 
A feature to test and simulate rulesets in Rule Designer and Decision Center. It was deprecated in V8.8 

**XSLT: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation**
An XML processing language that is used to convert an XML document into another document in XML, PDF, HTML, or other format.
