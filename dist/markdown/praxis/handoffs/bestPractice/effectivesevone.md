# Effective Handoffs for Severity One Issues

When it comes to effectively handing off a case from one team to another, it is essential that both parties understand the premise of the situation.

* Confirm the Client reported problem is in fact a Severity 1 issue and requires 24x7 support.
* Warm hand-off should be attempted by contacting the next geography as stipulated in the contact reference file (CRF).  
* The Case needs to be updated with all the actions taken prior to handing case over using this template:

    **Problem:** Brief summary description of problem.
    
    **Action Taken:** Document what trouble shooting has already taken place and what the next steps are, i.e. client waiting for call, client getting logs, etc.
    
    **Action Plan:** Handing CASE over to next Team to continue working with client.
