Access to cases in Salesforce is restricted by the level of <a href="https://ibm.box.com/v/SF-Need-To-Know-Policy" target="_blank">Need to Know</a> every person using Salesforce has. Without Need2Know, Salesforce will not display Cases and you won't even find & see the Cases in Global Search.

We differentiate between the following scenarios for Need2Know:
 * [Permanent Access through membership in Support Mission](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/access#mission)
 * [Permanent Access to a single Case](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/access#case)
 * [Permanent Access to a Case by being added to the Case Team](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/access#caseteam)
 * [Permanent Full Access to all Cases of an Account](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/access#account)
 * [Permanent Full Access to all Cases for an Upline Manager](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/access#upline)
 * [Temporary full Access to all Cases via Duty Manager shift](/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/agents/case/access#dm)
