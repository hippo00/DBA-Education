### Below are some general statements of Client Personas, Likes, Dislikes, and Best Practices for working with clients.
 
**Client Personas**
* Impressed by hard data.
* Issues are taken seriously
* Pay extra attention to discussed time frames.
* Make excessive demands only to be in a good starting position for negotiation.
* Result-driven.

**Likes**
* Appreciate some small talk.
* Open and transparent communication.
* Simple and direct talk, no convoluted statements.

**Dislikes**
* Beating around the bush and unclear action plan.
* Missing a deadline.

**Best Practices**
* Never forget to ask them “How is your day” and engage in some small talk, especially when this is not the first contact with the client.
* Establish contact with a clear plan and update them what has been done in the meantime.
* NEVER discuss politics, religion, or race as these are likely to be a sensitive topic.
* Whilst there's some regional variation with the US, past a certain company size it is much less important than company culture.
