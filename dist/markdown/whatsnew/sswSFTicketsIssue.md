### Salesforce tickets created or updated after March 11 not included in Support Search with Watson

On March 11, 2019 we found issues affecting the formatting of Salesforce tickets in Support Search with Watson (SSW). This was caused by a local setting configuration in the SDS repository, our source for Salesforce tickets. The SDS team is aware of this problem and working to resolve it. While this work is being done we have temporarily paused the extraction of SF tickets from SDS, which means no new tickets or updates to tickets in Salesforce made after March 11 are being shown in SSW. Once the data is corrected in SDS we will reingest all the tickets from SDS. We still donâ€™t have a definitive ETA for completing this work but early estimates indicate this may be completed by the end of March.
