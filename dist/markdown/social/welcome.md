### Getting Social

Welcome to the Social Support User's Guide. This is the only place you need to go to learn how to participate in Social Support activities and programs within IBM Technical Support.  If you need to learn how to write a blog, create a video, post or post to social media - start here.  Maybe you have heard of the exciting new advocacy program called <a href="https://w3-connections.ibm.com/communities/service/html/communitystart?communityUuid=60450750-399d-436d-9a30-62e0f6bc6d5c" target="_blank">IBM VIP Rewards Community </a> and want to learn how to participate. If so, you are in the right place!  

We are excited to be part of this new content platform, designed to be a 'one stop shopping' experience for all matters related to Technical Support.  One of our favorite features is the ability for you, the user, to engage with the authors by way of posting likes/dislikes and comments as they relate to the specific article you are reading.  Your participation will go a long way to ensure our content is current, relevant, and accurate. We will be monitoring for your feedback.

The Support Transformation initiative has impacted all aspects of the way we do business in the Technical Support area. New tools and procedures have changed just about everything we do.  As a result of this, most of our existing process documentation is becoming outdated as the new processes come online.  However,since the transformation is a lengthy process, the old procedures will remain valid until the new ones are enabled.  So the publishing of our new pages describing how to create and post in these channels will need to align with the migration to the new tools and processes. In the meantime, we will reference the *existing* content from within these pages, then update it as the new procedures come online. You should always be able to find the *current* process from now on in these pages.
