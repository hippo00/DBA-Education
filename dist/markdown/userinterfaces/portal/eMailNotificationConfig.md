## How Clients can configure Case Email Notifications on the Community Portal
Case Email Notification options, accessible in your settings, will allow you to choose when you receive email notifications related to your cases in the IBM Support community. You can customize these options to determine which case-related changes will prompt an email notification. The new Case Email Notification options ensure that you only receive the updates which are most important to you.

From the IBM Support Community website, click on the User Icon in the top right corner of the page. Select My Settings. From there you will be directed to the “My Settings” page. Here you can select your desired case notification preferences under the “Case notifications” header. You will need to have the box next to “Enable email notifications for my case activity” checked in order to make specific case notification selections.
