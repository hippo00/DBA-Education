## Overview 

The power of Blueworks Live is evident when teams are working together on one project. Multiple people can collaborate on the same process blueprint at the same time. 

Once development is completed, the blueprint can be shared in multiple ways such as, exporting to a document, or copying a space that contains that blueprint to another account.
