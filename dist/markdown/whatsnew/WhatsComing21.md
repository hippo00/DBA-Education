## Agent Console Updates
### <a href="https://funnel.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/#/open/4227" target="_blank">#4227</a> - Changes to Escalated checkbox, and the additions of the Milestone Warning and Milestone Missed checkboxes 
#### Although announced previously, this is now targeted for Sprint 22.
*  The Escalated field is now agent settable from the Case Details page, and is no longer auto-tethered to milestone warnings/missed milestones.
*  Because the Salesforce logic on the built-in Escalated field caused the flag to be removed when a case was closed, we added two new milestone checkboxes to track missed milestones, Milestone Warning and Milestone Missed.  These are not cleared when the case is closed. 
* Details on these fields and associated logic have been added to the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/dba-support/DBA-Education/#/DBA-Education/process/case/fields" target="_blank">DBA-Education.</a> DBA-Education.
