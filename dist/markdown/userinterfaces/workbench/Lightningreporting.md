# Charts in Reports
* When your report contains more than 2,000 results the chart will also only contain data for those 2,000 online displayed records.
* You may be able to see the entirety of chart data if you minimize the details, however, if your summarized version is still more than 2,000 rows of results you will only see chart data for those results visible on the page.
* Pie Charts are not available in Lightning.  Instead, use a donut chart.
* Using bucketed fields in charts will break them (Visible while editing, but not when you run the report).

# Dashboards
•	After saving a dashboard in Lightning Experience, you cannot edit it in Salesforce Classic. Instead of editing a Salesforce Classic dashboard in Lightning Experience, consider cloning the dashboard and editing the clone. That way, you can still edit the original dashboard in Salesforce Classic.
